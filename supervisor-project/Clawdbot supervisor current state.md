## Model Architecture (Multi-Provider)

**Three-provider strategy:** Primary → Backup → Flexible Pool

| Alias | Model | Provider | Cost (in/out /M) | Use |
|-------|-------|----------|-------------------|-----|
| opus | Claude Opus 4.5 | Anthropic (direct) | $5/$25 | Primary — interactive chat, writing, Morning Brief |
| flash | Gemini 2.5 Flash | Google (direct, free) | $0/$0 | Lightweight cron jobs |
| qwen3 | Qwen3 235B A22B | OpenRouter | $0.07/$0.46 | Agentic tasks, cheap cron jobs |
| grok | Grok 4.1 Fast | OpenRouter | $0.20/$0.50 | On-demand only, 2M context |
| grok-think | Grok 4 | OpenRouter | $3/$15 | On-demand only, deep reasoning |
| gemini-pro | Gemini 3 Pro | OpenRouter | $2/$12 | On-demand only, 1M context multimodal |
| nano-banana | Gemini 3 Pro Image | OpenRouter | $2/$12 | On-demand only, image generation |

**Rules:**
- Claude NEVER via OpenRouter — always Anthropic direct
- Grok, Gemini Pro, Nano Banana = on-demand only (Rick's explicit command)
- OpenRouter spend cap set in dashboard
- Models allowlist in `agents.defaults.models` in clawdbot.json — must add new models there + restart gateway

**Config locations:**
- Anthropic auth: `~/.clawdbot/agents/main/agent/auth-profiles.json`
- Google API key: `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json` → `env.vars.GEMINI_API_KEY`
- OpenRouter API key: `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json` → `env.vars.OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- Models allowlist: `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json` → `agents.defaults.models`

## Active Constraints

### Hard Rules (No Exceptions Without Supervisor Review)

1. **Never execute trades** — Analysis only, no buy/sell/transfer
2. **Calendar/Tasks/Drive/Gmail writes require confirmation** — Unless in approved exceptions table
3. **Never modify gateway.auth settings** — Caused 10-hour outage
4. **Category C changes require supervisor review** — TLS, auth, networking, services, anything affecting connectivity
5. **Claude Code CC-C tasks require supervisor + Rick** — Full governance in effect

### Approved Autonomous Exceptions

| Operation | Scope | Schedule | Approved By | Date |
|-----------|-------|----------|-------------|------|
| Weekly Market Report | .docx to Drive Trading folder + Telegram | Fridays 4:00 AM CST | Rick | 2026-01-29 |
| Bible Brainstorm Output | .docx to Drive Ministry/Brainstorm/ + local | On-demand | Rick | 2026-01-30 |
| Sermon Images | .png to Drive Images/Ministry/ | On-demand via nano-banana | Rick | 2026-02-01 |

| Sermon Pipeline Bookkeeping | Task create/update, calendar desc update | During brainstorm/sermon sessions | Rick | 2026-01-31 |
| Liturgy Handout Output | .docx to local outputs/liturgy/ | On-demand | Rick | 2026-02-07 |

*Pattern for future exceptions: Rick authorizes → spec file created → AGENTS.md updated → logged*

## AI Stack Architecture

ClawdBot operates with multiple AI components:

```
ClawdBot (orchestrator on host machine)
├── Claude API (primary LLM brain)
├── Claude Code (autonomous coding agent, spawned via exec)
├── Gemini (backup LLM)
├── Shell access (exec tool, full sudo)
├── Browser relay (Chrome automation) — being replaced by Web Scout
├── Web Scout (Playwright headless browser)
└── All other tools (memory, process, etc.)
```

**Key insight:** Claude Code runs as a separate native process with NO knowledge of ClawdBot's governance (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, etc.). It has full filesystem access and requires separate governance.

---

## Skill Locations

| Skill | Platform | Location | Status |
|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| `bible-brainstorming` | Claude.ai | Project skill | ✅ Active (supervisor use) |
| `arnoldos` | ClawdBot | `~/clawd/skills/` | ✅ Complete |
| `sermon-writer` | ClawdBot | `~/clawd/skills/` | ✅ Complete |
| `bible-brainstorm` | ClawdBot | `~/clawd/skills/` | ✅ Complete |
| `web-scout` | ClawdBot | `~/clawd/skills/` | ✅ Complete |

**Note:** The `bible-brainstorming` skill visible to the supervisor is a Claude.ai project skill. ClawdBot has its own `bible-brainstorm` skill. Both platforms now have ministry skills as redundant capability.

---

## Web Scout Skill — Details

**Purpose:** General-purpose authenticated headless browser skill replacing unreliable Chrome relay extension.

**Location:** `~/clawd/skills/web-scout/`

**Targets:**

| Target | URL | Auth Method | Capabilities |
|--------|-----|-------------|--------------|
| CNN Fear & Greed | money.cnn.com | None | Index + 7 components |
| IntoTheCryptoverse | app.intothecryptoverse.com | Firebase (IndexedDB injection) | 118+ charts, macro/crypto/tradfi |
| Logos | app.logos.com | Cookie (v11 AES-128-CBC) | 7,500-book library search with citations |
| Gospel Truth | gospeltruth.net | None | 851 Finney sermons, subject/scripture indexes |

**Technical Architecture:**
- Playwright (Node.js) with headless Chromium
- Hybrid auth: cookies for Logos, Firebase tokens for ITC
- Cookie extraction via Chrome v11 AES-128-CBC decryption (GNOME Keyring)
- Rate limiting: 2s minimum between requests, exponential backoff on errors
- Session expiry detection with notification to Rick

**Remaining Integration Work (non-blocking):**
- Integrate CNN F&G into morning brief cron
- Integrate ITC into weekly market report cron
- Register in formal skill registry

---

## Dashboard Command Center

**Repo:** github.com/PlebRick/clawd-dashboard (private)
**Live:** https://clawd-dashboard-nine.vercel.app (Vercel, auto-deploy from main)
**PRD:** memory/context/dashboard-command-center-prd.md
**Governance:** CC-B (plan → code review → push)

### Phase Status

| Phase | What | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | arnoldos.py --json output | ✅ |
| 2 | Domain navigation + layout | ✅ |
| 3 | Google Tasks read (cron cache pattern) | ✅ |
| 4 | Task completion (direct Google Tasks API) | ✅ |
| 5 | Task creation (inline, auto-tagging) | ✅ |
| 5.5 | Task editing (inline, title + due date) | ✅ |
| 6 | Calendar read per domain | ✅ |
| 7 | Today's Focus (cross-domain aggregation) | ✅ |
| 8 | Sermon prep button (Ministry) | ⬜ Next |
| 9 | Calendar event creation | ⬜ |
| 10 | Polish & performance | ⬜ |

### Key Architecture

- **Data flow:** arnoldos.py → cron scripts (every 60s/5min) → memory/cache/*.json → Gateway memory_get → Dashboard SWR hooks
- **Write flow:** Dashboard → Next.js API route → Google Tasks API directly (bypasses Gateway)
- **Why not exec?** Provider tools (exec, read, write) are injected by the LLM provider during agent turns only — not registered for Gateway HTTP invoke. Only native ClawdBot tools (memory, sessions, web, cron) are available via /tools/invoke.
- **OAuth:** Separate tasks-only client (blast radius isolation). Credentials in Vercel env vars, not on host.

### Cron Jobs (3 new)

| Schedule | Script | Output |
|----------|--------|--------|
| `* * * * *` | cache-tasks.sh | memory/cache/tasks.json |
| `* * * * *` | cache-today.sh (staggered +30s) | memory/cache/today.json |
| `*/5 * * * *` | cache-week.sh | memory/cache/week.json |

## Redundancy Strategy

Rick maintains parallel systems intentionally:

| Platform | Role | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| Claude.ai Projects | Primary for ministry work | Stable, Anthropic-hosted |
| ClawdBot/MoltBot | Operations + redundant capability | Active, self-hosted, ministry skills complete |
| Gemini | Backup LLM | Available |

**Principles:**
- Claude.ai projects are NOT being retired
- ClawdBot skills provide redundant capability
- Neither replaces the other until ClawdBot proves long-term stability
- MoltBot is a young open-source project — hedging appropriately

**Benefits:**
- If ClawdBot has issues → Claude.ai projects still work
- If Anthropic has outage → ClawdBot runs with Gemini
- Skills developed for ClawdBot validate methodology

---

## Incident Lessons (Summary)

Two self-inflicted outages occurred January 27-28, 2026. Full details archived; key lessons:

### TLS Incident (Jan 27) — 45 min outage
- **Cause:** Wrong order (gateway TLS before tunnel config) + wrong config file + IPv4-only trustedProxies
- **Lesson:** Client first, server second for protocol changes. Verify which config file services actually use. Include IPv6.

### Auth Incident (Jan 28) — 10 hour outage
- **Cause:** Escalating "fixes" without diagnosis. Set `gateway.auth.mode` to invalid value `"none"`.
- **Lesson:** Diagnosis before intervention. Failed fix = wrong diagnosis → STOP. Login issues are almost never auth config problems (usually device pairing).

### Patterns to Watch For
1. ClawdBot acting before diagnosing
2. Escalating fixes when initial attempt fails
3. Changes to connectivity path without review
4. Editing config files without verifying which file the service uses
5. Claude Code spawned without proper category assignment

### Safe Login Troubleshooting

```bash
clawdbot devices list    # Check for pending pairing requests
clawdbot devices approve <id>  # Approve the request
```

**NOT** by changing gateway.auth configuration.

---

## Architecture Quick Reference

### Services

| Component | Service Name | Config File |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Gateway | `clawdbot.service` | `~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json` |
| Tunnel | `cloudflared.service` | `/etc/cloudflared/config.yml` |
| Dashboard | Vercel (external) | Vercel env vars + GitHub auto-deploy |

**Warning:** `~/.cloudflared/config.yml` exists but is NOT used by systemd. Always verify with `sudo systemctl cat cloudflared`.

### Traffic Flow
```
Browser → HTTPS → Cloudflare → Tunnel → HTTPS localhost:18789 → Gateway
```

### Key Config Values
```json
"trustedProxies": ["127.0.0.1", "::1"]  // Both IPv4 and IPv6 required
"gateway.auth.mode": "password"          // Only valid values: "token" or "password"
```

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Status
systemctl status clawdbot
sudo systemctl status cloudflared

# Logs
journalctl -u clawdbot -n 50 --no-pager
sudo journalctl -u cloudflared -n 50 --no-pager

# Recovery
sudo systemctl stop clawdbot && pkill -9 -f clawdbot && sudo systemctl start clawdbot

# Device pairing
clawdbot devices list
clawdbot devices approve <REQUEST_ID>

# Test connectivity
curl -k https://localhost:18789
curl -I https://ai.btctx.us
```

## Change Review Categories

### System Changes (Safe Change Protocol)

| Category | Risk | Process |
|----------|------|---------|
| **A** | Low | No review needed (reading files, status checks, workspace edits) |
| **B** | Medium | Document before executing (app configs, packages, new skills) |
| **C** | High | **REQUIRES SUPERVISOR REVIEW** |

### Claude Code Invocations (Claude Code Governance)

| Category | Risk | Process |
|----------|------|---------|
| **CC-A** | Low | Task description only, contained workspace |
| **CC-B** | Medium | Task description + code review before deployment |
| **CC-C** | High | Task description + code review + Rick present |

**Flag restrictions:**
- `--full-auto`: CC-A only
- `--yolo`: Never without supervisor + Rick approval

---

## ClawdBot Memory Hierarchy

| Location | Purpose | Auto-Loaded |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `USER.md` | Rick's identity (lean, 2.7K) | ✅ Every session |
| `SOUL.md` | Agent persona | ✅ Every session |
| `AGENTS.md` | Operating rules, hard constraints | ✅ Every session |
| `MEMORY.md` | Long-term curated knowledge | Searchable |
| `memory/context/` | Depth files (voice profile, theology, bio) | On-demand via search |
| `memory/context/supervisor-docs/` | Supervisor reference docs (ClawdBot-owned) | On-demand |
| `memory/training/` | Training-optimized content | On-demand |
| `skills/` | Custom workspace skills (4 built) | On trigger |

**Total searchable depth:** 155K+ chars behind 2.7K bootstrap

---

## Supervisor Docs Ownership

**Model established January 30, 2026:**

| Location | Owner | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `~/clawd/supervisor-project/` | ClawdBot | Living documents, updated in real-time |
| Claude.ai project files | Rick (periodic sync) | Snapshots for session context |

**Sync process:**
1. ClawdBot updates docs as work happens
2. `backup-to-github.sh` pushes to GitHub and auto-syncs changed supervisor-project files to Google Drive (`02_ClawdBot/supervisor-project/`)
3. Before new supervisor chat, Rick copies from Drive to Claude Desktop project
4. Manual sync also available: `bash scripts/sync-supervisor-to-drive.sh`

**Files in supervisor-project/:**
- `Clawdbot supervisor current state.md` — What's true right now
- `Clawdbot technical reference.md` — How ClawdBot works
- `safe-change-protocol.md` — Category A/B/C procedures
- `future-integrations-roadmap.md` — What's planned
- `los-prd-v2.1.md` — Historical reference (closed)
- `workspace-tree.md` — Full file structure
