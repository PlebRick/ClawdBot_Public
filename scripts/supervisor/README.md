# scripts/supervisor/

This directory is **Claude Code's workspace** for supervisor-related scripts.

ClawdBot (Clawd) does not write to this directory. If ClawdBot needs to add supervisor-related scripts, Rick coordinates the placement.

## Purpose
Scripts created or modified by Claude Code during code-server sessions that relate to:
- System monitoring
- Automated repairs
- Supervisor tooling
- Diagnostic utilities

## Ownership
- **Claude Code** writes here via code-server
- **ClawdBot** reads but does not write
- **Rick** arbitrates conflicts
