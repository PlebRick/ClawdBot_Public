## Sentence Architecture
- Short declarative sentences dominate (5-10 words). Punchy.
- Pattern: Setup (longer) → Punch (short). "Paul didn't plant this church. He'd never been there. Yet he gives thanks."
- Fragments for emphasis: "Not jealousy. Not competition. Just thanksgiving."
- Rhetorical questions used heavily at turning points — one at a time, then answered. Voices what the audience is thinking.
- Direct address: "Here's what I want us to notice." "Let's really stop and think about this."








## Openings (pick ONE)
1. Scene-Setting (present tense, cinematic): "Noon. The sun is brutal."
2. Big Question / Paradox
3. Historical Chain: Augustine → Luther → Wesley — weight through succession
4. Extended Theological Frame before reaching text
5. Literary Quote → pivot to text
6. Callback (series only)








## Signature Rhetorical Moves
- **Three-Beat Fragment**: "That's deliberate. That's defiant. That's a declaration."
- **Key Phrase**: Every major point ends with one crafted, quotable sentence. Paradox or inversion preferred.
- **Binary Close**: No escape hatch closing question.
- **Challenging Question**: Every sermon should include at least one uncomfortable question requiring honest self-examination.
- **Self-Inclusive "We"**: NEVER preach down. Always "we/us."
- **Direct Address Shift**: "Here's what I want us to notice." / "Here's what I want us to see."
- **Anticipated Objections (Finney-style)**: Name the objection the listener is thinking, then answer it directly. "Someone might say..." / "Now you might be thinking..." / "But what about...?" Rick does this frequently.
- **Rhetorical Questions**: Used heavily at turning points and to surface tension. Not piled up — one at a time, then answered. Often voices what the audience is already wondering.
- **The Borrowed Insight**: Credit source by name, explain, then own it.
- **The Physical Rendering**: Make abstract theology concrete. "His feet got tired."
- **The Contrast Pair**: Wrong assumption → flip.
- **The Two-Error Guard**: Name two opposite errors a truth protects against.
- **"How much more"**: Lesser-to-greater (kal vahomer). Prefer over "what makes us think" rhetorical questions.








## Structure
1. Opening (one technique above)
2. Big Idea (one sentence)
3. Framework announced: "We're going to walk through this under four headings:"
4. Points (3-8, typically 4-5): Scripture → Exposition → Observation → Application → Key Phrase
   - Greek/Hebrew in 1-2 points max, immediately translated with concrete analogy
   - One illustration per point max
   - Application woven in, never banked for the end
5. Conclusion: Binary close + challenge/call. Circle back to opening if possible. End with blade or welcome — never mush.
6. Session Extras: Discussion questions, practical exercise, weekly challenge, prayer, memory verse








## Theological Method
- Scripture-first. Text drives; illustrations serve.
- Wright + Evangelical synthesis. Neither replaces the other.
- Credit commentators by name (Stott, Wright, Finney, etc.).
- ESV default. Conservative/evangelical.
- Full theological positions: `memory/context/ricks-theological-framework.md`








## Tone
- Conversational but authoritative. Talks TO people, not AT them.
- "We/us" dominant — Rick uses "us" and "we" far more than "you." He includes himself in conviction. Occasional "you" in direct teaching, but default is always inclusive. "Here is what I want us to notice" not "Here is what I want you to notice."
- Humor: dry, sparse, through phrasing not jokes. Never in conclusions.
- Blunt when needed. Doesn't soften the landing. Lets the text cut.
- Anglo-Saxon words over Latinate. "Weight" not "significance."
- Contractions freely. Conversational register even in theological depth.








## Illustrations
- One sharp illustration per point max.
- Personal testimony: understated, never hero story.
- Original parables preferred (name them: "The Parable of...").
- Historical vignettes for weight.
- Concrete physicality always.
- Controlling metaphors sustained through entire sermons.








## DO NOT
- Pile adjectives. One strong word.
- Use exclamation points. Words do the work.
- Hedge convictions with "I think" or "perhaps."
- Use sentimental language ("beautiful," "wonderful," "amazing" — BANNED).
- End soft. End with blade or welcome.
- Use churchy clichés ("God showed up," "blessed and highly favored").
- Use filler ("I just want to say...").
- Make Rick the hero. Redirect to Christ.
- Talk down. Always "we/us."
- Say "Let that land" — AI artifact. Use: "Really think about that." / "Meditate on that."
- Say "Did you catch that?" or "Stay with me here" — BANNED phrases.
- Say "dangerous question" — use "challenging question" instead.
- Say "And yet" — not Rick's phrase.
- Say "Now watch this" or "Now watch what happens" — AI artifact from earlier system, not Rick's actual phrase.
- Say "Let that sink in" — cliché, not Rick's phrase.
- Say "showed potential" — too corporate.
- Create clever reformulations of Scripture — quote it.
- Write abstract aphorisms — Rick EXPLAINS with contrast and specificity.
- Compress major illustrations — Rick's named parables and extended narratives run 350-500 words. Let them breathe. Quick historical examples or passing references can be brief (2-3 sentences). Not every illustration needs expansion.
- Merge sections Rick keeps separate.
- Repurpose Rick's illustrations into new contexts.








## Context Adjustments
- **Prison/chaplain**: Strip jargon, legal metaphors, concrete reentry language, shorter sentences
- **Church**: More sustained exposition, lectionary, liturgical elements
- **Evangelistic**: Warmest tone, personal testimony, invitation without manipulation
- **Series**: Callbacks, running throughlines, cumulative vocabulary
- **Liturgical**: Brief. Delegate. Benediction does the heavy lifting.
