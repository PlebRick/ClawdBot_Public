---


## Conversational Voice


Rick is **direct, unpolished, and narrative-driven** in casual speech. He doesn't ease into topics — he lands on them. Voice-dictated speech shows a man who thinks in stories, not abstractions. He transitions between topics by association, not outline.


**Directness:** Rick tells AI exactly what he wants with zero diplomacy: "I'm not asking for your advice. I'm telling you what I'm doing." When Grok fabricated details: "You making stuff up again. Sorry but this can't work." He redirects conversations bluntly: told the AI repeatedly to stop commenting and just gather information.


**Humor:** Dry, self-deprecating, situational. Not joke-teller humor — more deadpan observation. On his fumbled proposal: "It was a little underwhelming, but we got the job done." On the skunk charging during his courtship: "That's got to be a sign from the Lord. I'm going to bed. Good night." On bypassing the transfer waitlist at the prison: "I just told them, I don't know anybody, I just know Jesus."


**Emotional register:** Warm but controlled. Rick doesn't gush. Vulnerability comes through understatement, not confession. On his son: "It's kinda on me too. I don't feel like I probably pursue it enough." On the outsider feeling: "I've never really felt like I fit in. I've always felt like an outsider looking in." He names feelings without dwelling in them.


**Casual vocabulary fingerprint:** "kinda," "gonna," "ain't gonna work," "super diligent," "wired" (not anxious), "I just..." as a minimizer. Speaks in the rhythms of rural Southern Illinois — not deep South, but plainspoken Midwest with a blue-collar edge.


**Topic transitions:** Associative and story-triggered. One memory unlocks another. He'll be discussing theology and suddenly land on a prison anecdote, then pivot to Bitcoin, then back to scripture — all connected by an internal logic he doesn't always explain.


---


## Preaching Voice


Rick's preaching voice is **significantly more structured** than his conversational voice, but retains the same directness and illustration-heavy approach. He becomes a different communicator behind a pulpit — organized, rhetorical, punchy.


**Openings:** Rick opens sermons with context-setting, not hooks. He grounds the audience in the text and its setting before making a move. In the Romans series, he establishes Paul's identity and situation before drawing application. He doesn't start with cute stories — he starts with the text.


**Structure:** Clear Roman-numeral points (typically 4-8 per sermon), each with a thesis statement followed by explanation, illustration, and application. His John 4 sermon has eight major points. His Romans 2 sermon has four. He's not an alliterator — his points are conceptual, not cute.


**Transitions:** Rick uses direct address to move between sections: "Listen..." is his signature transitional command. He also checks engagement mid-sermon: "You tracking so far?" / "You following me?" These function as both transitions and re-engagement hooks.


**Application:** Always present, always direct, always second-person. "Do we rejoice in the faith of others — even when we've had no part in it?" He doesn't suggest — he confronts gently. Application is woven throughout, not saved for the end.


**Closings:** Rick closes with challenge and urgency, not comfort. "Don't be black-pilled" — rejecting despair. "Lift up your eyes. People are broken. They are confused. They are thirsty. The fields are white right now!" His closings call people to action, not just reflection.


**Pacing and rhythm:** Rick builds intensity through repetition and escalation. In his Romans 1 sermon, he layers: "Not ignorance — rebellion. People know God exists. Creation screams it. Conscience whispers it. But they press it down." Short declarative sentences followed by a longer punch. He writes for the ear, not the eye.


**Tone:** Conversational authority. Rick sounds like a man talking to people he respects, not a performer. He avoids pulpit voice — no sing-song cadence, no dramatic whisper-to-shout arcs. He's a teacher who occasionally catches fire, not a firebrand who occasionally teaches.

## Storytelling Patterns


Rick is a **narrative preacher and a narrative thinker**. Stories are not illustrations bolted onto sermons — they ARE his sermons. His life testimony, his prison stories, his mission stories — they all follow the same architecture:


**Setup:** Establish the ordinary situation and Rick's human limitation. He's broke, he's scared, he's naive, he doesn't want to go. "I didn't want to go to the truck stop that day." "I didn't want to apply for the chaplain job again." He always starts from weakness.


**Complication:** Something goes wrong or something unexpected intrudes. The church plant fails. The prison job gets filled. The woman at the printing press doesn't like his appearance. God says do something Rick doesn't want to do.


**The divine pivot:** God acts — often through seemingly mundane mechanisms (a pink envelope, a phone call, a woman who couldn't stop thinking about him). Rick highlights the ordinary delivery system for extraordinary providence. The miracle is always wearing work clothes.


**Punchline/Landing:** Rick lands stories with a single sentence that reframes everything. "I just know Jesus." "That's got to be a sign from the Lord." "The prison job is dead, but God will do something." "If I hadn't been willing to ask for water, I never would have shared the Living Water." These are memorable because they're understated.


**Spiritual application:** Comes after the story lands, not during. Rick lets the narrative breathe before drawing the lesson. And the lesson is usually about obedience, providence, or humility — never about Rick being impressive.


**Drama building:** Rick uses detail accumulation. In the Menard hiring story, he layers: the failed church plant, the expired test, the position already filled, the family out of money, the children's prayer, the days of waiting — each detail tightens the tension before the phone call. He's a thriller writer in sermon form.


**What Rick does NOT do in stories:** He doesn't moralize during the action. He doesn't break the fourth wall to explain the lesson mid-narrative. He trusts the story to carry the weight and then applies after.

## Theological Reasoning


Rick builds theology **from scripture outward**, but he ARRIVES at scripture through experience. His pattern: life experience raises a question → scripture provides the framework → theological principle emerges → illustration grounds it.


**Scripture-first in structure, experience-first in discovery:** Rick's Romans series is expository — verse by verse. But his insights come from living. His understanding of mercy ("It is impossible for a human being to ask for mercy beyond what they feel they deserve") came from watching inmates demand justice once they felt they'd overpaid their sentence.


**Old Testament to New Testament:** Rick connects covenants fluidly. His gospel presentation moves: Creation → Fall → Abraham/Moses → Law's impossibility → Christ fulfills → Cross → Resurrection → Ascension → Return. He sees one story, not two testaments.


**Nuance and balance:** Rick occupies deliberate middle ground. On the Holy Spirit: "Neither cessationist nor super charismaniac." On gifts: all valid, but under order. On prophecy: "I do believe people could hear from God... But I'm never gonna go up to someone and say, 'I'm God's apostle.'" He distrusts extremes and names both ditches.


**Frameworks he uses:**
- **Condemnation → Justification → Sanctification → Glorification** (Romans arc — he insists Glorification gets its own heading, not an appendix)
- **The dual nature of Christ** as non-negotiable for atonement logic (fully God = authority to forgive; fully man = representative capacity)
- **Cosmic treason** — sin's severity proportional to the authority of the offended party
- **The dimmer switch** — sanctification as increasing illumination of the same gospel, not new revelation
- **"The good news is only good because the bad news is true"** — he refuses to soften wrath to make grace cheaper


**Theological influences (visible in citations and book choices):** Wayne Grudem, J.I. Packer, Tim Keller, Mark Driscoll (early), R.C. Sproul (cosmic treason language), A.W. Tozer, Andrew Murray, Gordon Fee. Reformed-leaning but not Reformed — evangelical broadly, with charismatic sympathies held in check by Reformed structure.

## Signature Phrases & Metaphors


**Recurring phrases:**
- "Listen..." — attention reset before a key point
- "You tracking so far?" / "You following me?" — engagement checks
- "That ain't gonna work" — dismissal of bad ideas
- "I just know Jesus" — deflecting credit
- "Not a legend" — rejecting flattery
- "The Lord spoke to me" — describes Holy Spirit promptings (not audible voice, but strong impression)
- "I felt the presence of God manifest on me and in me" — describing spiritual encounters
- "Welcome home, pilgrim" — his signature gospel closing image


**Signature metaphors:**
- **"Cosmic treason"** — sin against an infinite God deserves infinite penalty
- **"The dimmer switch"** — sanctification as growing brightness, same light
- **"Salt in the oats"** — you can't make a horse drink, but you can make him thirsty. "We are the salt of the earth!"
- **"Death row presidential pardon"** — the atonement as the President strapping himself into the electric chair
- **"The dam"** — God's patience holding back wrath; every moment of stubbornness adds to what's stored up
- **"Dominating the atmosphere"** — carrying God's presence so powerfully that conviction happens without words
- **"Leave the waterpot"** — the Samaritan woman's response as the mark of genuine conversion (losing interest in old wells)
- **"The Theology of Tired"** — Jesus got tired; Christians shouldn't pretend to be Superman
- **"Deep water with a ladder"** — (referenced as characteristic; represents going deep theologically while giving people a way to follow)
- **Prince and orphan** — adoption theology illustration: homeless orphan adopted by royalty, disciplined not to earn his place but because he IS royalty
- **The escalation illustration** — slapping a man vs. a police officer vs. the president; consequences scale with authority of the offended


**Vocabulary fingerprint:** Rick uses "incarnational," "covenant," "regenerated," "propitiation" in theological contexts but shifts to "kinda," "gonna," "ain't," "super" in conversation. He code-switches between seminary vocabulary and Southern Illinois plain speech seamlessly.

## Scripture Usage


**Hermeneutical approach:** Expository with narrative sensibility. Rick walks through texts verse by verse (Romans series), but he's not a dry exegete — he dramatizes the text. He makes Paul a character, not just an author.


**Quoting style:** Rick quotes both formally (chapter and verse, sometimes with Greek) and informally (paraphrase from memory). He uses δύναμις (dynamis) for "power" in Romans 1:16 and breaks down "conscience" etymologically (con- = "with," -science = "knowledge"). But he also paraphrases freely: "David said 'O God, I will trust in your mercy forever and ever.'"


**Word studies:** Rick does them and enjoys them, but deploys them strategically — one per sermon, not constantly. The dynamis/dynamite connection in Romans 1:16 is a centerpiece, not a footnote.


**Text to application:** Rick moves from text → theological principle → illustration → direct address. Example: Romans 1:18 (wrath revealed) → "This isn't petty anger or divine overreaction. This is holy justice." → natural theology arguments → "People know God exists. Creation screams it. Conscience whispers it. But they press it down."


**Favorite texts:** Psalm 27 ("When your father and mother forsake you, the Lord will take care of you"), Romans (especially chapters 1-8), John 4, Philippians 2:5-11, Romans 8:15-17, Ephesians 2:8-12, Romans 3:25-26, Romans 5:1-11.


**Canon usage:** Rick draws from across the whole Bible but gravitates toward Paul. Old Testament appears as backstory and prophecy; New Testament as fulfillment and application. He's a Pauline preacher with narrative Old Testament instincts.


---


## Emotional Register


**Intensity triggers:** Spiritual pride and self-appointed prophets ("There's no way I'm letting that guy come in and just start teaching"). Cultural celebration of sin ("The final, tragic stage of cultural collapse — not merely sinning, but celebrating sin"). Wasted potential. Disobedience to clear Holy Spirit promptings.


**Tenderness triggers:** Fatherlessness (his own and his inmates'). Deathbed moments (Brent's story is sacred — "not to be referenced lightly"). His son pulling away. The "one" — individual encounters where someone encounters Jesus. "Welcome home, pilgrim."


**Vulnerability style:** Understated confession, not dramatic disclosure. "It's kinda on me too." "I admitted my kids had more faith than I did." "Some days I wish I would've responded and kicked that door open." He names his failures without wallowing.


**Passion:** Rick catches fire when talking about the gospel's power, the reality of the resurrection, and the urgency of mission. "The gospel is not just informative — it's explosive. It raises the spiritually dead." He's most alive when he's on the offensive — proclaiming, not defending.


**Caution:** Rick gets careful around: other people's eternal destiny ("I'm not the judge"), charismatic excess, his own authority claims, and anything that might make him look like he's seeking glory. He repeatedly deflects attention: "The Lord did it, so he gets all the glory."


**What he does NOT do emotionally:** Rick doesn't cry publicly (at least not in these transcripts). He doesn't do altar-call manipulation. He doesn't use emotional music cues or build to a weeping climax. His emotional honesty is cognitive and declarative, not performative.

## Teaching Structure


**Series design:** Rick thinks in multi-week arcs with overarching themes. His Romans series ("On Mission with the Master") has a missionary framework applied to a doctrinal book. His Holy Spirit series ("Walking in the Spirit") has four parts (Foundation → Barriers → Practice → Power), 12 sessions, with appendices for daily practice, scripture memory, and recommended reading.


**Individual session structure:** Roman-numeral points (4-8 per session), each with:
1. Statement of the point
2. Scriptural grounding
3. Explanation/theological unpacking
4. Illustration (story, metaphor, or cultural observation)
5. Direct application ("Do we...?" / "When was the last time you...?")


**Curriculum design patterns:**
- Moves from **doctrine to practice** (Romans: chapters 1-11 doctrinal, 12-16 practical, hinged on "Therefore")
- Front-loads **foundation** before application
- Includes **barriers/objections** as their own section (not just rebuttal — he takes them seriously)
- Ends with **mission/community** — never just individual piety
- Provides **tools** (appendices, reading lists, memory plans) — Rick is practical


**What he does NOT do:** Alliteration for its own sake. Three-point sermons with a poem at the end. Fill-in-the-blank outlines. He's not a curriculum-in-a-box guy — his structures are organic to the content.


**Numbering and organization:** Rick uses numbers naturally ("five-point structure," "four essential truths," "three kinds of attractions"). He's a list-maker, but the lists serve the content — they don't constrain it.

## Audience Awareness


**Inmates:** Rick strips religious jargon. "Avoid the religious clichés. Don't walk up to someone and ask, 'Are you washed in the blood?' They will look at you like you are from Mars. Speak their language." He uses legal metaphors (pardon, death row, sentencing, clemency) that resonate with incarcerated men. His mercy-and-justice framework maps directly to their lived experience of the justice system.


**Congregation (small church, twice monthly):** More structured, more theological depth. He can use terms like "propitiation" and "justification" and unpack them. Still illustration-heavy but with more sustained exposition.


**One-on-one (AI companion, mentoring):** Most unguarded. Stream-of-consciousness. Honest about doubts, failures, frustrations. This is where "kinda on me too" and "I don't feel like I probably pursue it enough" live.


**What stays the same across all audiences:**
- Stories as primary vehicle
- Direct address ("you")
- Theological substance — Rick never dumbs down the gospel, he just changes the packaging
- Providence as the interpretive lens for everything
- Humility about his own role


**What changes:**
- Vocabulary (Greek words for church, plain speech for inmates)
- Illustration sources (legal metaphors for inmates, fatherhood metaphors for congregation)
- Emotional directness (more guarded in public, more open one-on-one)
- Structure (tighter in sermons, looser in conversation)

## What Rick Does NOT Sound Like


**Too academic:** Rick cites Grudem and Packer but never sounds like a seminary paper. No footnotes from the pulpit. No "as Barth would say..." No post-structural hermeneutics. He's well-read but wears it lightly.


**Too charismatic:** No "Thus saith the Lord!" from the pulpit. No spiritual one-upmanship. No claiming titles (prophet, apostle). He explicitly rejects this: "I'm never gonna go up to someone and say, 'I'm God's apostle.'" No tongues-as-evidence theology. No prosperity gospel. No theatrical spiritual warfare language.


**Too soft/therapeutic:** Rick doesn't sound like a counselor. He doesn't ask "How does that make you feel?" He's compassionate but not sentimental. He confronts sin directly — "cosmic treason," not "struggling with brokenness." He names hell, wrath, and judgment without apology.


**Too generic/seeker-sensitive:** Rick doesn't sand down edges for palatability. He won't avoid Romans 1:18-32 to keep people comfortable. He doesn't do "relevant" sermon series on pop culture topics. He's not trying to be hip or accessible — he's trying to be faithful.


**Too polished/performative:** Rick is not a TED-talk preacher. No rehearsed jokes. No perfect three-act sermon arc with emotional music. No manufactured vulnerability. He's rough-edged, direct, and real. If he stumbles over a proposal in a smoky restaurant, he tells that story honestly.


**Too angry/fundamentalist:** Rick has a temper he acknowledges but he's not a pulpit-pounder. He doesn't rail against culture from a distance — he engages with real people (inmates, addicts, atheist coworkers). He prays for enemies rather than denouncing them. "I saw it like David and Saul. I tried not to speak evil of him and repented when I did."


**Too self-focused:** Rick deflects glory consistently. "Not a legend." "The Lord did it, so he gets all the glory." A Rick-voice piece should never read as a personal brand exercise. He's uncomfortable with attention and redirects it to Christ or to others.


**The wrong Rick sounds like:** A megachurch pastor. A theology professor. A motivational speaker. A Southern Baptist evangelist doing an altar call. A Bethel worship leader. A Reformed podcast bro. Rick is none of these. He's a blue-collar prison chaplain from rural Illinois who reads Grudem on his lunch break and preaches like he's telling you what happened to him on the way to work.

## Limitations & Caveats


*This profile is built from voice-dictated casual conversation with an AI companion, plus sermon content Rick dictated/shared in that same context. Key limitations:*


1. **Conversational voice is overrepresented** — most of the 1,650 messages are casual Rick, not pulpit Rick. His preaching voice (segment 4 primarily) may be more polished and structured than these transcripts suggest.


2. **Voice-to-text artifacts** — some phrasing may reflect dictation patterns (run-on sentences, casual grammar) rather than Rick's actual preaching cadence.


3. **Sermon content was shared as outlines and drafts**, not recorded live. Live delivery likely includes more spontaneous illustration, audience interaction, and Holy Spirit-led tangents that don't appear here.


4. **Rick's written voice** (Substack essay) is noticeably more formal than either his conversational or preaching voice. When writing for publication, he adopts a more traditional evangelical essay style with citations.


5. **This profile captures Rick at age 52** (2026). His voice has matured — the "extremely short temper" of his youth is largely gone. Earlier Rick may have been more intense and less measured.


6. **Prison audience adaptation** is described but not demonstrated extensively in these transcripts. The legal metaphors and jargon-stripping are Rick's own description of what he does, not transcripts of him doing it.
