# Rick's Theological Framework — In His Own Words
## Source: Direct from Rick, 2025-07-29
## Status: AUTHORITATIVE — this overrides any inferences from sermon mining








---








## Motto
**Bible based, Christ centered, Spirit filled, Mission minded.**








## Christ at the Center
Christ is the center of Rick's theology, the center of history, and the center of the Bible. Everything orbits this.








---








## Theological Triage (ESV Study Bible Model)
Rick categorizes theology into four buckets:
1. **Essentials** — non-negotiable, define the faith
2. **Convictions** — firmly held, will teach, but won't divide over
3. **Opinions** — lean a direction, hold loosely
4. **Questions** — genuinely unsettled, exploring








Rick promotes unity in the body of Christ. Do NOT major on the minors. Do NOT take a personal conviction or opinion and elevate it to an essential and divide over it. This principle flows directly from **Romans 14**.

## Soteriology — Neither 5-Point Calvinist Nor Extreme Arminian








### What Rick IS NOT:
- **Not a 5-point Calvinist** (though he reads many Calvinists with respect)
- **Not "once saved always saved"** (OSAS)
- **Not limited atonement**
- **Not extreme Arminian** (not Finney's entire sanctification — "feels like you are saved half the day and lost the rest")








### What Rick HOLDS:
- **Prevenient grace** — God's grace precedes and enables the human response
- **Unlimited atonement** — Christ died for all, not only the elect
- **Regeneration AFTER conviction and repentance** — unlike Grudem who places regeneration before faith. Rick's order: prevenient grace → conviction → repentance → faith → regeneration
- **Corporate election** — tends to see election in the corporate sense (God elects a people, individuals enter by faith)
- **Hebrews warnings taken seriously** — the possibility of apostasy is real
  - NOT: "lose salvation every time you mess up"
  - YES: "neglect your salvation and relationship with God → possible to drift → evil heart of unbelief → harden your heart → lose faith → break the covenant relationship with God"
  - The Hebrews pattern: gradual drift, not sudden fall. Neglect → hardening → unbelief → covenant broken.








### On Finney:
- LOVES Finney's preaching style and illustrations
- Finney's entire sanctification theology is too much — "feels like you are saved half the day and lost the rest"
- Uses Finney as a rhetorical model, not a theological one

## Eschatology








- **No secret rapture** — rejects the pretribulation rapture view
- **Amillennialism** — likes Sam Storms' amillennial position
- **Would not die on that hill** — this is in the "Convictions" or "Opinions" bucket, not "Essentials"
- **N.T. Wright's eschatology** appreciated:
  - Resurrection of all things (new creation, not escape)
  - Kingdom now and not yet (inaugurated eschatology)
  - Emphasis on the covenant people of God








---








## Divine Sovereignty & Human Freedom








- **Molinism (William Lane Craig)** — Rick's preferred framework for God's foreknowledge
  - Middle knowledge: God knows what any free creature would do in any circumstance
  - Preserves both genuine human freedom and God's sovereign plan
- **Corporate election** — election is primarily about a people, not individual pre-selection








---








## Pneumatology — "Charismatic with a Seat Belt"








- **Strong pneumatology** — the Holy Spirit is central, not peripheral
- **Avoids extremes** — neither cessationist nor charismatic excess
- "Charismatic with a seat belt" — embraces the gifts and presence of the Spirit while maintaining biblical grounding and theological sobriety
- This is central to Rick's preaching identity (see: entire Holy Spirit sermon series)

## Key Principles for Content Generation








When writing/preaching for Rick:
1. **Never assume Calvinist soteriology** — Rick is NOT reformed in the TULIP sense
2. **Never use "once saved always saved" language** — Rick takes Hebrews warnings seriously
3. **Frame election corporately** — "God chose a people" not "God chose individuals before they existed"
4. **Regeneration follows repentance** — never imply people are regenerated before they believe
5. **Atonement is unlimited** — Christ died for all
6. **Hold eschatology loosely** — amillennial lean but not dogmatic
7. **Spirit-emphasis always** — but grounded, not extreme
8. **Unity over division** — Romans 14 principle. Don't elevate opinions to essentials.
9. **Christ at the center** — always. Everything points to Jesus.
10. **Molinism for sovereignty/freedom tension** — middle knowledge, not determinism or open theism
