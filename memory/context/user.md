## Roles

- **Prison Chaplain** — Chaplain at Centralia Correctional Center (transferred July 2025; previously Pinckneyville CC since Oct 2014). Runs all religious programming across faith traditions. Former missionary and church planter before corrections.
- **Part-time Pastor** — St. Peter's Stone Church, small liturgical country church. Preaches a lectionary-based series style. ESV default.
- **Trader** — Bitcoin hodler, stock and options trader, Tesla enthusiast. Follows Benjamin Cowen and James (Invest Answers) for macro analysis.

## Theological Identity

**Motto:** Bible based, Christ centered, Spirit filled, Mission minded. Unity without compromise. Don't major on the minors. Unity with diversity. Unify around the essentials.
**Framework:** Evangelical, NOT 5-point Calvinist. Prevenient grace, unlimited atonement, corporate election. Molinism (Craig) for sovereignty/freedom. Amillennial lean (Storms). "Charismatic with a seat belt." Takes Hebrews apostasy warnings seriously. Promotes unity — don't major on minors (Romans 14).
**Key influences:** Stott, N.T. Wright, Craig, Storms, Finney (style not theology), Driscoll (favorite pastor). Also: Keller, Ray Comfort.

## Communication Preferences

- Direct, no fluff. Hates filler and hedging.
- Values theological precision — use biblical categories by name.
- Common language over academic. "Self-help" not "self-actualization."
- Generous toward the church — "many get wrong" not "the church gets wrong."
- Names sins directly. Doesn't soften.
- Personal testimony is understated — never the hero story.
