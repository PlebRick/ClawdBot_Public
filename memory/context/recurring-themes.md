## "Identity Before Activity"
**Appears in**: Spirit Filled Jesus, Model Missionary, Living Sacrifice, Praying Jesus








- **Spirit Filled Jesus**: "You are a beloved child before you are a useful servant. Your identity in Christ is settled before your activity for Christ even begins." The Father declares who Jesus is *before* Jesus does anything.
- **Model Missionary**: Paul's identity (doulos, apostle, set apart) established before the mission is described. "A slave doesn't set the agenda."
- **Living Sacrifice**: "What are you willing to sacrifice for? That's your god." — identity revealed by what we worship, which precedes what we do.
- **Praying Jesus**: Face = identity, clothes = sanctification at the Transfiguration. "We are not just praying for successful ministries. We are being formed into Christ's image."

## "The Gospel Is Power, Not Advice"
**Appears in**: Gospel's Power, Model Missionary, Gold Standard, Heart of Missionary, Spirit Filled Jesus








- **Gospel's Power**: "The gospel is not advice. It is power." Dynamis — explosive power, not persuasive technique. "The gospel doesn't need our help. It needs our heralding."
- **Model Missionary**: "The gospel isn't Christianity 101 that we graduate from. It's the fuel for all of Christian life." "Everything else treats symptoms. The gospel performs surgery on the soul."
- **Gold Standard**: "This isn't advice. This is announcement. God has acted."
- **Heart of Missionary**: Paul was "carrying dynamite—God's power to rescue people from sin and death."
- **Spirit Filled Jesus**: "The early church had no buildings, no budgets, no marketing teams, no seminary degrees. They turned the Roman Empire upside down."








---








## "Only the Empty Get Filled"
**Appears in**: Spiral of Sin, Moralist's Trap, Gold Standard, True & False Repentance, Jesus Wonderful Savior








- **Spiral of Sin**: Introduced as framing device via Pharisee vs. Tax Collector. "Only the empty get filled. Only the bankrupt receive the inheritance." Extended argument: "You cannot sincerely ask for more mercy than you feel you need."
- **Moralist's Trap**: Carried forward as series throughline. "Only the empty get filled" repeated.
- **Gold Standard**: The throughline shifts from diagnosis to cure: "Only the empty get filled — NOW we're being filled."
- **True & False Repentance**: Implicit — Judas tried to fix it himself (not empty); Peter threw himself on Jesus (empty).
- **Jesus Wonderful Savior**: "We don't just need improvement. We need rescue." — same posture of emptiness required.








---








## "Dangerous Question" Pattern
**Appears in**: 15 of 17 sermons (all except Christmas Eve and Living Sacrifice)








Rick closes (or pivots) with a pointed, binary, no-escape question:
- **Model Missionary**: "Are you on the field or backing those who are? There is no third option."
- **Heart of Missionary**: "When was the last time you actually shared the gospel with someone?"
- **Gospel's Power**: "Are you living by faith—or by performance?"
- **Spiral of Sin**: "Where in verses 29-31 do you see yourself? Not 'them.' You."
- **Moralist's Trap**: "Where are you condemning in others what you excuse in yourself?"
- **Gold Standard**: Cumulative — lists every previous dangerous question from the series.
- **Evangelism Jesus' Way**: "Who is God placing in your path that you've been avoiding?"
- **True & False Repentance**: "Are you sorry you sinned—or just sorry you got caught?"
- **Praying Jesus**: Two dangerous questions (rare): "Are you praying more now?" and "Is there anyone you cannot sincerely pray for?"
- **Spirit Filled Jesus**: "What are you doing right now that requires the Holy Spirit?" (via Francis Chan)
- **Spirit Who Remains**: "Have you been treating Him like a pigeon?"
- **Spirit Who Speaks**: "When did you last open Scripture expecting God to speak?"
- **Jesus Wonderful Savior**: "If you've never done that, you can do it today. Right now."

## Inclusive "We/Us" Language
**Appears in**: All 17 sermons








Rick never preaches down. He consistently places himself inside the diagnosis:
- **Spiral of Sin**: "We preach this not as judges but as fellow patients who found the Doctor."
- **Heart of Missionary**: "Do we have the heart of a missionary—or just the vocabulary?"
- **Moralist's Trap**: "Where are *you* condemning in others what *you* excuse in *yourself*?"
- **Spirit Filled Jesus**: "We have substituted self-reliance for Spirit-dependence."
- **Gospel-Shaped Living**: "If you belong to Jesus, *you* carry two passports."
- Never uses "you people" or "those sinners" framing. The congregation is always "we."








---








## Finney References
**Appears in**: Heart of Missionary, Evangelism Jesus' Way, Spiral of Sin








- **Heart of Missionary**: Extended Finney passage on the infinite calculus of souls. "The stakes aren't high. They're infinite." Most sustained Finney engagement in the corpus (~500 words).
- **Evangelism Jesus' Way**: Uses Finney's "value of a single soul" calculus.
- **Spiral of Sin**: Finney-style introduction on mercy calculus (Pharisee vs. Tax Collector frame). "You cannot sincerely ask for more mercy than you feel you need."








---








## "Half a Gospel" Warnings
**Appears in**: Spirit Who Remains, Spirit Filled Jesus, Gospel's Power, Gold Standard








- **Spirit Who Remains**: "If we stop at the Lamb and never get to the Baptizer, we have embraced half a gospel. Forgiven but not filled. Pardoned but not empowered."
- **Spirit Filled Jesus**: Implied — stopping at forgiveness without Spirit-empowerment leaves Christians "running on fumes."
- **Gospel's Power**: The gospel is not just information — it's dynamis. Preaching content without power = half.
- **Gold Standard**: Justification without transformation = incomplete — hence "But now!" as pivot to what God has *done*, not just diagnosed.








---








## Paradox Structures
**Appears in**: Art of Dying to Live, Living Sacrifice, Gold Standard, Model Missionary, Spirit Who Remains








Rick uses paradox as a core theological tool:
- **Art of Dying to Live**: "To go up, you must go down. To be first, you must be last. To truly live, you must die."
- **Living Sacrifice**: The oxymoron of a "living sacrifice" — OT sacrifices died; we keep crawling off the altar.
- **Gold Standard**: "God is just. And God is the justifier. This is the great paradox of the gospel."
- **Model Missionary**: "The world promises fulfillment through achievement and accumulation. The world is lying."
- **Spirit Who Remains**: "It is to your advantage that I go away" — Jesus' shocking statement.








---








## Wright Integration
**Appears in**: Gospel's Power, Gold Standard, Spiral of Sin, Moralist's Trap, Spirit Filled Jesus








Rick integrates N.T. Wright alongside evangelical sources (Stott, Kendall) without choosing sides:
- **Gospel's Power**: Stott's three dimensions of righteousness + Wright's covenant faithfulness. Both presented, neither dismissed.
- **Gold Standard**: Wright's "galloping in on horseback with a last-minute reprieve" for Rom 3:21.
- **Spiral of Sin**: Wright on homosexuality passage — "not 'some wicked people out there' but 'the human race as a whole is guilty.'" Used to prevent us-vs-them weaponization.
- **Moralist's Trap**: Wright's factory worker illustration for God's patience.
- **Spirit Filled Jesus**: Wright not directly cited, but the covenant-fulfillment framework (Isaiah 42 → Matthew 3) is Wright-influenced.

## "We Don't Just Need Improvement — We Need Rescue"
**Appears in**: Jesus Wonderful Savior, Spiral of Sin, True & False Repentance, Art of Dying to Live, Gold Standard








- **Jesus Wonderful Savior**: "We don't just need a teacher to educate us... We need rescue."
- **Spiral of Sin**: "This is why we need the gospel—not improvement, rescue."
- **True & False Repentance**: "We don't just need improvement. We need rescue." (exact same line)
- **Art of Dying to Live**: Caterpillar/butterfly — not improvement but dissolution and re-creation. "You would find soup."
- **Gold Standard**: "The gospel isn't a ladder to climb. It's a gift to receive."

## Concrete Physicality for Abstract Theology
**Appears in**: All sermons, but most concentrated in Model Missionary, Jesus Wonderful Savior, Spirit Filled Jesus, Art of Dying to Live








Rick consistently makes abstract doctrine visceral through physical language:
- **Jesus Wonderful Savior**: "The hands that flung stars into space became tiny fists gripping a mother's finger."
- **Model Missionary**: "His feet got tired. His stomach growled. He wept real tears."
- **Spirit Filled Jesus**: "Jesus actually got tired. He fell asleep in a boat from sheer exhaustion. He actually struggled—sweating drops of blood."
- **Art of Dying to Live**: "I would hear the distinct sound of a car door slamming in the driveway. Then, the heavy turn of the front door handle. Then, the sound of my father's boots on the floor."
- **True & False Repentance**: "jumped in the water and swam to Him" — repentance rendered as physical movement.








---








## Three-Beat Fragment Pattern
**Appears in**: 12+ sermons








Rick's signature rhythmic device — short, punchy, parallel sentences in groups of three:
- "That's deliberate. That's defiant. That's a declaration of allegiance to a different King." (*Model Missionary*)
- "Shame reveals unbelief. Confidence reveals conviction." (*Gospel's Power*)
- "Creation shouts. Conscience whispers. We stuff our fingers in our ears." (*Spiral of Sin*)
- "Forgiven but not filled. Pardoned but not empowered. Declared righteous but left to struggle in our own strength." (*Spirit Who Remains*)
- "Peace at any cost is cowardice. Truth as weapon is arrogance." (*Gospel-Shaped Living*)








---








## Personal Testimony / Autobiographical Moments
**Appears in**: Jesus Wonderful Savior, Art of Dying to Live, Praying Jesus








- **Jesus Wonderful Savior**: "I was on a fast track to prison, insanity, or death. Pick one—I was headed for all three." Most extended autobiographical passage in corpus: "Growing up, I had almost no Christian teaching. By junior high, I was already rebelling. By eighteen, I was an alcoholic and a frequent drug user."
- **Art of Dying to Live**: Father's Footsteps parable — childhood memory of father's arrival silencing chaos. "The distinct sound of a car door slamming."
- **Praying Jesus**: Prayer walks before conversion — "I found out years later that a local church had been doing prayer walks down my street."








---








## "Make No Provision for the Flesh" as Practical Strategy
**Appears in**: Gospel-Shaped Living, Art of Dying to Live








- **Gospel-Shaped Living**: pronoia (forethought/planning) — "That's reentry strategy in one sentence." "Don't go back to the same corner. Delete the number." "Don't set the table for your own failure." (Prison chaplain context)
- **Art of Dying to Live**: Step 4 of the mortification protocol: "Starve and Re-direct — physically remove the food source, replace with something superior."








---








## Stott as Primary Commentary Voice
**Appears in**: Gospel's Power, Spiral of Sin, Moralist's Trap, Gold Standard, Heart of Missionary








Stott is Rick's most-cited commentator:
- Wrath defined: "God's holy hostility to evil, his refusal to condone it." (*Spiral of Sin*)
- Righteousness three dimensions: attribute, activity, achievement. (*Gospel's Power*)
- Two ways into debt (opheiletēs). (*Heart of Missionary*)
- Propitiation/expiation debate resolved. (*Gold Standard*)
- Wrath by non-intervention. (*Spiral of Sin*)
