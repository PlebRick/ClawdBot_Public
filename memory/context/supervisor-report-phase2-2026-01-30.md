## Phase 2 Kickoff (earlier this session)


Opus approved Phase 2 with guidance:
- Voice-card: sermon-writer only
- Distinct descriptions critical
- Cross-reference "When NOT to use" in both skills
- No Phase status needed for generate skills
- Send sermon-writer for review before testing


## Phase 2 Completion


All five PRD success criteria met:
1. ✅ sermon-writer skill built, reviewed, fixes applied
2. ✅ bible-brainstorm skill built to merged spec
3. ✅ Trigger detection 10/10 pass
4. ✅ Voice authenticity: Rick rated 3-4/5 (threshold was ≥3)
5. ✅ Sequential workflow test: brainstorm → outline → summary → appendix → .docx


Additional deliverables beyond PRD scope:
- Voice-card comparison (ClawdBot vs Claude.ai) — merged and reconciled
- Voice-phrases catalog — merged from both sources
- Finney research sub-agent — 31KB reference doc, reusable specialist
- ArnoldOS complete-task command — first Phase 2 write capability
- Sub-agent management practice established
- Supervisor workflow documented


Full completion report submitted to Opus. Phase 3 delta analysis requested and provided.
