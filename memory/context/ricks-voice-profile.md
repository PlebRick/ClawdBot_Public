## 1. STRUCTURAL PATTERNS

### Opening Techniques (taxonomy with frequency)

**Scene-Setting / Present Tense Narrative** (5/17 sermons)
Rick drops the audience into a physical scene using present tense, short sentences. Often cinematic.
- "Noon. The sun is brutal. Everyone else drew water hours ago." (John 4)
- "Imagine the scene. A Jewish tentmaker sits down to write a letter." (Romans 1:1-7)
- "Jesus told a story about two men who went to the temple to pray." (Romans 1:18-32)

**Big Question / Paradox** (4/17 sermons)
Opens with a theological tension or uncomfortable question.
- "Why does Jesus need the Holy Spirit? If we get the answer wrong, we will misunderstand both Jesus and ourselves." (Spirit Filled Jesus)
- "How is your prayer life? Not 'Do you pray?' but how is the quality, the consistency, the depth of your communion with God?" (Praying Jesus)
- "The world says self-preservation, self-promotion, self-actualization. The Kingdom says: to truly live, you must die." (Art of Dying to Live)

**Historical Weight / Chain** (3/17 sermons)
Stacks historical figures to establish the text's transforming power.
- "Augustine... Martin Luther... John Wesley... John Bunyan. This book starts revivals. It sparks reformations." (Romans 1:1-7)
- Luther's 1515 breakthrough narrative (Romans 1:16-17)

**Callback to Previous Sermon** (4/17 — all series sermons)
- "Last week we met Paul the Model Missionary... But today Paul does something different. He opens his chest and shows us what beats inside." (Heart of Missionary)
- "Paul set a trap in Romans 1. And now, in Romans 2, he springs it." (Moralist's Trap)

**Literary/External Quote** (2/17 sermons)
- Opens with Augustine quote: "I have read in Plato and Cicero sayings that are wise and beautiful; but I never read in either of them: 'Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden.'" (Jesus Our Wonderful Savior)

**Extended Theological Frame** (1/17 — most ambitious)
- Pharisee vs. Tax Collector introduction with Finney's mercy calculus, sustained across 800+ words before reaching the text. "You cannot sincerely ask for more mercy than you feel you need." (Spiral of Sin)

### Point Structure & Transitions

**Outline style**: Roman-numeral points, typically 3-8 per sermon.
- 3-4 points: Romans 3:21-26 (Gold Standard), Romans 2:1-11 (Moralist's Trap), Spirit Who Remains
- 5-6 points: Heart of Missionary, Model Missionary, Spirit Filled Jesus
- 8 points: John 4 (Evangelism Jesus' Way)
- 10 points: Praying Jesus (longest sermon, ~37K chars)

**Alliterative structure** used in 3/17 sermons:
- Man, Message, Mission, Model (Romans 1:1-7)
- Inescapable, Intentional, Individual, Impartial (Romans 2:1-11)
- Revealed, Commissioned, Empowered, Imparted (Spirit Filled Jesus)

**Memory hooks** (4/17 sermons):
- "Two Titles — One Word — One Warning" (Spirit Who Remains)
- "Revealed → Commissioned → Empowered → Imparted" (Spirit Filled Jesus)
- "Revealed → Inspired → Illuminates" (Spirit Who Speaks)
- "Man, Message, Mission, Model" (Romans 1:1-7)

**Transition phrases** (characteristic set):
- "Now watch this." / "Here's where it gets interesting."
- "Stay with me here—this matters."
- "Let's unpack them." / "Let me push this further."
- "Here's the principle:" (distills complex theology into one statement)
- "Did you catch that?" (draws attention to easily missed detail)
- "Now here's what I want you to see:" / "Here's what I want you to notice."
- "Stop and consider something."
- "Here's the reality check."

**Internal point pattern** (consistent across all 17 sermons):
Scripture → Exposition → Observation → Application → Key Phrase
Each major point ends with a memorable, quotable line — crafted, not throwaway.

### Conclusion Techniques

**The Dangerous Question** (15/17 sermons — near-universal):
A binary question that removes escape hatches. No soft landing. Often prefaced with "Here's a dangerous question:" or "Here's the dangerous question."
- "If someone watched your life for a week, would they conclude Jesus is your master—or that you are?" (Romans 1:1-7)
- "Where in verses 29-31 do you see yourself? Not 'them.' You." (Spiral of Sin)
- "Who is God placing in your path that you've been avoiding?" (John 4)
- "Are you sorry you sinned—or just sorry you got caught?" (True Repentance)
- "When was the last time you actually shared the gospel with someone?" (Heart of Missionary)
- "Are you living by faith—or by performance?" (Gospel's Power)
- "Is there anyone you cannot sincerely pray for?" (Praying Jesus)
- "When did you last open Scripture expecting God to speak?" (Spirit Who Speaks)

**Challenge / Call to Action** (10/17):
- "Fight the fight. Finish the race. Keep the faith." (Romans 1:1-7)
- "Go unashamed. Go in power. Go to everyone." (Gospel's Power)
- "The fields are white. The souls are waiting. Will we go?" (John 4)
- "Repent. Believe. Be rescued." (Spiral of Sin)

**Return to Opening Frame** (6/17):
Rick circles back to his opening image or question, creating a complete arc.
- Opens and closes with the paradox: "To truly live, you must die" → "I invite you to die, so that you can finally, truly, live." (Art of Dying to Live)
- Opens with Pharisee/Tax Collector → closes with "Remember the tax collector." (Spiral of Sin)

**Benediction / Pastoral Close** (3/17):
- "Welcome home, pilgrim." (Jesus Our Wonderful Savior)
- "May you be filled with the wonder of Mary, the obedience of Joseph, the joy of the angels, the eagerness of the shepherds, the determination of the magi, and the peace of the Christ child." (Christmas Eve)
- "The mercy seat is open. Come." (Gold Standard)

### Named Illustration Labels (17/17 — universal in full manuscripts)
Rick explicitly titles his illustrations as named teaching units:
- "Illustration: The Parable of the Father's Footsteps" (Art of Dying)
- "Illustration: The Parable of the Broken Bridegroom" (Art of Dying)
- "Illustration: The Caterpillar and the Butterfly" (Art of Dying)
- "Illustration: The Eclipse of the Soul (Sun vs. Marble)" (Art of Dying)
These are not just illustrations — they are **named parables** with titles. AI tends to flow into illustrations without labeling them. Rick gives them titles the audience can reference later.

### Sub-Section Architecture
Rick labels sub-sections within major points with letter designations:
- "A. The Oxymoron" / "B. Defining 'Dying to Self'" / "C. The Theology of 'Reckoning'" (Art of Dying, Section III)
This gives the audience handles for complex multi-part points. AI tends to flatten this structure.

### You/We Alternation Pattern
Rick deliberately alternates between "you" and "we":
- **Teaching mode**: "you" — "You don't 'feel' dead to sin; you 'reckon' it as a legal fact."
- **Shared conviction**: "we" — "We do not offer ourselves to God to earn His favor."
- **Direct application**: "you" — "You wake up every morning and say: 'I am dead to my own agenda.'"
AI tends to over-correct everything to "we," losing Rick's intentional shifts.

### Sermon Length & Pacing
- **Shortest**: Spirit Who Remains (~1,550 words / ~11 min)
- **Typical range**: 3,000-5,000 words (20-35 min)
- **Longest**: Praying Jesus (~37K chars), Spiral of Sin (~27K chars)
- Rick can be concise when structure is tight (Spirit Who Remains) or expansive when argument requires it (Spiral of Sin's Finney introduction)

### Session Extras (17/17 — universal)
Every sermon includes: Discussion Questions, Practical Exercise, Weekly Challenge, Prayer, Memory Verse.
The Dangerous Question always reappears in the discussion questions, often as question 6 or 7, marked [DANGEROUS QUESTION].

---

## 2. RHETORICAL SIGNATURES

### Three-Beat Fragments (12/17 sermons)
Rick's most distinctive verbal fingerprint. Three short parallel phrases building intensity.
- "That's deliberate. That's defiant. That's a declaration of allegiance to a different King." (Romans 1:1-7)
- "Not jealousy. Not competition. Not 'Well, I wish I'd been the one to reach them.' Just thanksgiving." (Heart of Missionary)
- "Obligated... eager... unashamed" vs. "Optional... reluctant... embarrassed" (Heart of Missionary)
- "Creation shouts. Conscience whispers. We stuff our fingers in our ears." (Spiral of Sin)
- "His time belonged to Jesus. His money belonged to Jesus. His future belonged to Jesus. His very life belonged to Jesus." (Romans 1:1-7 — four-beat variant)
- "Forgiven but not filled. Pardoned but not empowered." (Spirit Who Remains)
- "Not ignorance—rebellion." → "Creation screams it. Conscience whispers it." (Spiral of Sin)
- "Battles are won in prayer before they're fought in the open." (Praying Jesus)

### Key Phrase Technique (17/17 — universal)
Every major point in every sermon ends with a single memorable sentence. These are clearly crafted — often paradox, inversion, or compression.
- "We don't own the gospel. We owe it." (Heart of Missionary)
- "Evil wins when it makes you become like it." (Living Sacrifice)
- "God's most terrifying judgment is not sending fire. It's stepping back." (Spiral of Sin)
- "The gospel isn't a ladder to climb. It's a gift to receive." (Gold Standard)
- "Shame reveals unbelief. Confidence reveals conviction." (Gospel's Power)
- "Your works are not your resume. They're your reveal." (Moralist's Trap)
- "Strength creates responsibility, not privilege." (Gospel-Shaped Living)
- "Same failure. Same sorrow. Different direction." (True Repentance)
- "The stakes aren't high. They're infinite." (Heart of Missionary)
- "You are a beloved child before you are a useful servant." (Spirit Filled Jesus)
- "Evangelism begins with being human, not impressive." (John 4)

### The Dangerous Question (15/17 — see Conclusions above)
Rick's signature closing move. Binary, pointed, no escape. Two sermons have TWO dangerous questions (Praying Jesus, model+discussion variants).

### Self-Inclusive Language (17/17 — universal)
Rick never preaches down. Always uses "we" and "us" for conviction.
- "We preach this not as judges but as fellow patients who found the Doctor." (Spiral of Sin)
- "So let me ask us:" (recurring phrasing)
- "So am I." (after convicting statement, Spiral of Sin)
- "Are we listening? Or are we taking the long way around?" (John 4)

### Direct Address Shifts (15/17)
Rick breaks expository flow to speak directly to the audience. Signals something important.
- "Here's what I want you to notice." (Romans 1:1-7)
- "Stay with me here—this matters." (Romans 1:1-7)
- "Did you catch that?" (multiple sermons — 8+ uses across corpus)
- "Now here's a question for us:" (Romans 1:1-7)
- "Let that land." (multiple sermons — 5+ uses)
- "Let me push this further." (Heart of Missionary)
- "Stop and consider something." (Heart of Missionary)
- "Now watch what happens next." (John 4)

### Humor Placement & Style
Rick's humor is **dry, sparse, and situational** — not a joke-teller. Wit comes through phrasing, not punchlines. Humor appears:
- In self-deprecation: "I was a terror" (childhood story, Art of Dying)
- In devastating pivots: "Gossips, slanderers, arrogant, boastful—That's church people." (Spiral of Sin)
- In absurdist compression: "You wouldn't find a half-caterpillar/half-butterfly. You would find soup." (Art of Dying)
- In sarcastic inversion: "The pagan gossips shamelessly. The moralist shares 'concerns' and 'prayer requests.'" (Moralist's Trap)
- Humor is NEVER in the conclusion. Always in exposition or illustration. Never at God's expense.

### Greek/Hebrew Word Introduction (14/17 sermons)
Rick introduces one or two Greek/Hebrew words per sermon, always with immediate translation and a concrete modern analogy.
- doulos = slave, purchased property (Romans 1:1-7)
- latreia = priestly service — "prayer IS the ministry" (Heart of Missionary)
- opheiletēs = debtor (Heart of Missionary)
- katechō = to hold down, restrain, imprison — "Imagine someone trying to hold a beach ball underwater" (Spiral of Sin)
- logizomai = banking term, "reckon" — "look at the ledger and accept the math as fact" (Art of Dying)
- hilasterion = mercy seat (Gold Standard)
- metamorphoo = metamorphosis (Art of Dying, Living Sacrifice)
- meno = abide, stay, take up permanent residence (Spirit Who Remains)
- pheromenoi = nautical term, wind in sails (Spirit Who Speaks)
- dynamis = explosive power (Gospel's Power)
- shuv / metanoia = turn/return, change of mind (True Repentance)
- syschematizo vs. metamorphoo = external mold vs. internal change (Living Sacrifice)
- pronoia = forethought/planning — "engineer your environment" (Gospel-Shaped Living)

Pattern: introduce term → give literal meaning → give concrete analogy → apply theologically. Never shows off. Always serves clarity.

## 3. THEOLOGICAL VOCABULARY & INTEGRATION

### Wright + Evangelical Synthesis (Rick's distinctive method)
Rick holds N.T. Wright's covenant faithfulness lens alongside traditional evangelical categories without choosing sides. He uses Wright where Wright adds insight, Stott where precision matters, and others where weight is needed.

**Examples of integration**:
- Romans 1:17: Combines Stott's three dimensions of righteousness (attribute, activity, achievement) with Wright's covenant faithfulness interpretation. Neither replaces the other. (Gospel's Power)
- Romans 1:26-27: Uses Wright's reading ("not 'some wicked people out there' but 'the human race as a whole is guilty'") to prevent the text from becoming an "us vs. them" weapon. (Spiral of Sin)
- Romans 3:21-22: Wright's "galloping in on horseback with a last-minute reprieve" deployed alongside traditional courtroom justification language. (Gold Standard)
- Romans 2:4: Wright's factory worker illustration for God's patience with purpose. (Moralist's Trap)

### Commentary Integration Style (Stott, Wright, Kendall, Finney, others)
Rick credits sources by name, explains the insight, then owns it.
- "John Stott made an observation that changed how I think about this." (Heart of Missionary)
- "Charles Finney once made an observation that has haunted me ever since I first encountered it." (Heart of Missionary, John 4)
- "Thomas Chalmers called this 'The Expulsive Power of a New Affection.'" (Art of Dying)
- "Francis Chan asks an uncomfortable question:" (Spirit Filled Jesus)

**Frequency**: Stott appears in 6/17 sermons, Wright in 5/17, Finney in 3/17, Chalmers in 1/17, Chan in 1/17, Packer in 1/17.

### Exegesis → Application Flow
Rick's consistent pattern: **Text drives; illustrations serve.**
1. Read the text (often quotes ESV in full at the sermon's head)
2. Expose what's in the text through careful word study
3. Draw one observation/principle
4. Illustrate with one sharp illustration (historical, personal, or metaphorical)
5. Apply directly in second person: "Do we...?" / "When was the last time you...?"
6. Land with a key phrase

Application is **woven throughout**, not saved for the end. Every major point has its own application. (17/17 sermons)

### Systematic Theology Woven Into Expository Preaching
Rick doesn't lecture on doctrine in the abstract. Doctrinal categories emerge from the text naturally.
- Hypostatic union taught through Romans 1:3-4: "His feet got tired. His stomach growled. He wept real tears." (Romans 1:1-7)
- Kenosis taught through Philippians 2 within the Spirit Filled Jesus sermon
- Propitiation taught through the Day of Atonement typology in Romans 3:25 (Gold Standard)
- Mortification taught through a 4-step protocol in Art of Dying to Live
- Natural theology (cosmological, teleological, moral arguments) taught within Romans 1:18-20 exposition (Spiral of Sin)

---

## 4. ILLUSTRATION & METAPHOR PATTERNS

### Original Parables / Extended Illustrations (Rick's most creative work)
- **The Father's Footsteps**: Rick as a child — car door, door handle, boots on floor. "Instantly, without anyone saying a word, the chaos vanished." The Presence silences the flesh. (Art of Dying)
- **The Broken Bridegroom**: Man left at altar → spiraling → goes to buy poison → meets second woman → consumed by new love → forgets the first. (Art of Dying)
- **The Caterpillar and the Butterfly**: Consumer → cocoon (dissolution, not improvement) → pollinator. "You wouldn't find a half-caterpillar/half-butterfly. You would find soup." (Art of Dying, Living Sacrifice)
- **The Eclipse of the Soul**: Sun (God's will) vs. marble (my will) held to the eye. "A tiny, cold, dead piece of glass can obscure a massive, burning star." (Art of Dying)
- **The Dove vs. The Pigeon**: Selective vs. garbage eater, easily startled vs. bold, gentle vs. assertive. The Spirit as dove, not pigeon. (Spirit Who Remains)

### Controlling Metaphors (sustained through entire sermons)
- **Courtroom**: Sustained throughout Gold Standard — judge, verdict, robe, justification
- **Spiral / Descent**: Structured descent through Spiral of Sin — suppression → exchange → judgment → applause
- **Concentric Circles**: Public → Community → Christ → Personal in Gospel-Shaped Living

### Concrete Physicality for Abstract Theology (14/17 sermons)
Rick's most consistent technique: rendering the abstract physical and sensory.
- "His feet got tired. His stomach growled. He wept real tears." (incarnation — Romans 1:1-7)
- "The hands that flung stars into space became tiny fists gripping a mother's finger." (incarnation — Jesus Our Wonderful Savior)
- "Imagine someone trying to hold a beach ball underwater." (truth suppression — Spiral of Sin)
- "Trading the sun for a flashlight with dead batteries." (idolatry — Spiral of Sin)
- "The full weight of divine justice fell on His own Son." (atonement — Gold Standard)
- "To a 1st-century Jew, the cross wasn't a piece of gold jewelry. It was a one-way ticket." (cross — Art of Dying)
- "She comes now. Alone." (John 4 — sparse, powerful)

### Personal Testimony / Vulnerability (5/17 sermons)
- Childhood rebellion and father's boots (Art of Dying — most intimate)
- Conversion: "By eighteen, I was an alcoholic and a frequent drug user." (Jesus Our Wonderful Savior — most autobiographical)
- "I was on a fast track to prison, insanity, or death. Pick one—I was headed for all three." (Jesus Our Wonderful Savior)
- Prayer walks on his street before conversion (Praying Jesus)
- Personal testimony is always understated, never the hero story. He names failures without wallowing.

---

## 5. EMOTIONAL DYNAMICS

### Weight-Building Through Repetition & Accumulation (11/17 sermons)
Rick builds intensity by stacking, not speeding up.
- Finney's infinite calculus: layers detail after detail of eternal suffering, then flips it to eternal joy, then asks "One soul is worth more than all the gold in the world." (Heart of Missionary — the longest sustained argument in the corpus)
- "His time belonged to Jesus. His money belonged to Jesus. His future belonged to Jesus. His very life belonged to Jesus." (Romans 1:1-7)
- Day of Atonement details: ark, mercy seat, blood application, broken law below, holy presence above (Gold Standard)
- Father's Footsteps: car door → door handle → boots on floor → chaos vanished (Art of Dying)

### When Humor vs. Gravity
- **Humor in exposition/illustration**: "You would find soup" / "That's church people" / "shares 'concerns' and 'prayer requests'"
- **Gravity in application and conclusion**: Never lightens the close. Never undercuts a dangerous question. The blade is always sharp at the end.
- **Humor as devastating pivot**: The best humor in the corpus functions as a weapon — "The pagan gossips shamelessly. The moralist shares 'concerns' and 'prayer requests'" turns a mirror on the audience.

### Pastoral Tenderness vs. Prophetic Challenge
Rick oscillates between these registers, often within the same sermon.
- **Tenderness**: "You are a beloved child before you are a useful servant." (Spirit Filled Jesus) / "Welcome home, pilgrim." (Jesus Our Wonderful Savior) / "The mercy seat is open. Come." (Gold Standard)
- **Challenge**: "If you can't remember, that's a problem." (Heart of Missionary) / "A slave doesn't set the agenda. A slave doesn't negotiate terms." (Romans 1:1-7) / "When evil gets a standing ovation, the culture is terminal." (Spiral of Sin)
- Pattern: The challenge is stronger when preceded by tenderness. Rick earns the right to confront by first affirming.

### Emotional Register Across Sermon Types
- **Evangelistic sermons** (Jesus Our Wonderful Savior, John 4): Warmest. Most personal. Closes with invitation, not blade.
- **Expository-doctrinal** (Romans series): Most intellectually intense. Challenge comes from the text, not from Rick.
- **Liturgical** (Christmas Eve, Spirit sermons): Most formal and brief. Rick restrains himself. Benediction does the work.
- **Deep dive** (Praying Jesus, Art of Dying): Most extended, most original illustrations, most pastoral.

## 6. CONTEXT-SPECIFIC VOICE DIFFERENCES

### The 3 Style Anchors — What Makes Each Different

**⭐ Romans 1:1-7 (Model Missionary)** — Expository-Academic-Declarative
- The most structurally clean sermon. Four alliterative points, each with sub-sections.
- Historical chain opening (Augustine → Luther → Wesley → Bunyan)
- Highest density of Greek word studies (doulos, hypostatic union)
- Tone: authoritative, teaching, building weight. This is Rick the professor.
- Key move: "This is either insanity or the most subversive thing imaginable."

**⭐ John 4 (Evangelism Jesus' Way)** — Narrative-Cinematic-Practical
- Opens in present tense: "Noon. The sun is brutal." Immediately physical.
- Eight-point structure (longest outline), each point brief and action-oriented
- Narrative-expository hybrid: walks through the passage in order, extracts principles at each stage
- Application at EVERY point (never banked for the end)
- Tone: urgent, warm, practical. This is Rick the evangelist-pastor.
- Key move: "A woman nobody wanted became an evangelist nobody expected."

**⭐ Christmas Eve Service** — Liturgical-Collaborative-Restrained
- NOT a standalone sermon. A full worship service order with multiple participants.
- Rick delegates (Lowell narrates, Maci solos, family sings O Holy Night)
- The only voice training material is the original benediction — a six-attribute ascending structure
- Tone: warm, brief, communal. This is Rick the liturgical pastor. He knows when to be brief.
- Key move: The benediction's cumulative rhythm: wonder → obedience → joy → eagerness → determination → peace.

### Prison Chaplain Rick vs. Pastor Rick

**Prison chaplain markers** (Gospel-Shaped Living, Praying Jesus):
- "For those of you preparing to go back into society" — direct reentry language
- "Make no provision for the flesh — that's reentry strategy in one sentence" — practical, street-level application
- Legal metaphors (pardon, death row, sentencing, clemency)
- "Don't go back to the same corner. Delete the number." — concrete, no abstraction
- Vocabulary stripped of religious jargon

**Pastor Rick markers** (Spirit series, Christmas Eve):
- Lectionary integration (weaving four readings into one sermon)
- Traditional hymn selection and liturgical structure (bell, candles, responsive readings)
- More sustained theological exposition (kenosis, shekinah, pheromenoi)
- Collaborative worship leadership (delegates to congregation members)
- Benedictions crafted from the sermon text

### Series Preaching vs. Standalone

**Series techniques** (Romans series — 8 sermons):
- Callbacks to previous sermon: "Last week..." / "Remember our question from last time..."
- Running throughline phrase: "Only the empty get filled" carries through Spiral of Sin → Moralist's Trap → Gold Standard
- Cumulative vocabulary building: anapologētos introduced in Romans 1, referenced again in Romans 2
- Series recap in Gold Standard conclusion: lists every previous dangerous question
- Trap structure: Romans 1 sets up the audience, Romans 2 springs the trap on them

**Standalone techniques** (John 4, True Repentance, Praying Jesus):
- Self-contained — must establish all context within the sermon
- Often more narrative-driven, less dependent on building doctrinal weight across weeks
- Practical exercises tend to be standalone too (The One Person, prayer journal)

---

## 7. WHAT RICK DOES NOT DO

- Does not use churchy clichés ("God showed up," "blessed and highly favored")
- Does not hedge or equivocate ("perhaps," "it seems," "I think" on core convictions)
- Does not talk down — assumes intelligence, uses "we" not "you should"
- Does not pile up adjectives. One strong word > three weak ones.
- Does not use exclamation points for emphasis. The words do the work.
- Does not end soft. Ends with a blade or a welcome — never with mush.
- Does not use sentimental language ("beautiful," "wonderful," "amazing" — banned)
- Does not over-illustrate. One sharp illustration per point, max.
- Does not separate theology from life. Every doctrine has a "so what."
- Does not use filler ("I just want to say..." / "It's really important that...")
- Does not do altar-call manipulation. Direct invitation without pressure tactics.
- Does not make himself the hero. Testimony is always understated, always redirects to Christ.
- Does not avoid hard truths. Names hell, wrath, judgment without apology.
- Does not force humor. Wit comes from phrasing, not setup/punchline.

## 9. THEOLOGICAL INFLUENCES (visible in corpus)

| Source | Frequency | How Rick Uses Them |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| John Stott | 6/17 sermons | Careful exegesis, balanced definitions, three-dimensional frameworks |
| N.T. Wright | 5/17 sermons | Covenant faithfulness, kingdom now/not-yet, resurrection of all things, covenant people of God |
| William Lane Craig | Key influence | Molinism (middle knowledge) — Rick's framework for sovereignty/freedom and foreknowledge |
| Sam Storms | Key influence | Amillennialism, continuationist pneumatology — shapes Rick's eschatology and Spirit theology |
| Charles Finney | 3/17 sermons | Preaching style and illustrations, revival urgency — NOT his entire sanctification theology |
| Wayne Grudem | Reference point | Systematic theology resource — Rick diverges on order of salvation (regeneration AFTER repentance, not before) |
| Thomas Chalmers | 1/17 sermons | "Expulsive Power of a New Affection" — replacement theology |
| Francis Chan | 1/17 sermons | Uncomfortable practical question about Spirit-dependence |
| J.I. Packer | 1/17 sermons | "Floodlight ministry" of the Spirit |
| Martin Luther | 2/17 sermons | Reformation breakthrough narrative, Romans 1:17 discovery |
| Augustine | 2/17 sermons | Conversion through Romans 13, literary quote on Christ's uniqueness |

Rick's theological method: **Evangelical with pastoral warmth, Wright-informed but not Wright-captive, Molinist on sovereignty/freedom, charismatic with a seat belt. NOT a 5-point Calvinist — holds prevenient grace, unlimited atonement, corporate election, and takes Hebrews apostasy warnings seriously.**

---

## 10. VOCABULARY & STYLE RULES

- Prefers Anglo-Saxon over Latinate: "weight" not "significance," "burning" not "passionate"
- Contractions used freely — conversational register maintained even in theological depth
- ESV is the default translation
- Avoids Christian jargon unless defining it immediately
- No filler phrases. No "I just want to say..."
- One strong word > three weak ones
- Short declarative sentences dominate (5-10 words), with longer sentences for exposition followed by short punchy landing
- Fragments for emphasis: "Not jealousy. Not competition. Not 'Well, I wish I'd been the one to reach them.' Just thanksgiving."
- Rhetorical questions placed at turning points, not piled up
- Binary contrasts as structural device: "Not what Paul did—but why he did it."
