## Pneumatology (Doctrine of the Holy Spirit)








**Core Position**: The Spirit is a Person who permanently indwells believers, not an occasional force. Jesus modeled Spirit-dependency as fully human, and believers follow the same pattern.








**Spirit as Permanent Indwelling**
- The old covenant Spirit came and went ("The Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul"); the new covenant Spirit *remains* (meno). (*Spirit Who Remains*)
- "Jesus is the hinge moment of redemptive history. He is the first human being on whom the Spirit takes up permanent residence." (*Spirit Who Remains*)
- Joel 2 fulfillment: "Not rationed to the few, but poured out on all. Not for isolated tasks, but for permanent indwelling. Not coming and going, but remaining." (*Spirit Who Remains*)








**Dove Sensitivity / Grieving the Spirit**
- "The Spirit is a dove, not a pigeon." Extended analogy: pigeons eat garbage and tolerate chaos; doves are selective, gentle, easily startled, mate for life. (*Spirit Who Remains*)
- "He will never leave the house—His remaining is positionally secure. But He is a Person, not a force. And persons can be grieved." (*Spirit Who Remains*)
- "If you are treating the Spirit like a pigeon—expecting Him to tolerate the garbage, the chaos, the noise—do not be surprised when the dove grows silent." (*Spirit Who Remains*)
- Cites Ephesians 4:30 ("Do not grieve the Holy Spirit") and 1 Thessalonians 5:19 ("Do not quench the Spirit"). (*Spirit Who Remains*)








**Spirit-Dependency of Jesus (Kenosis)**
- "If the sinless Son of God depended on the Holy Spirit to carry out his ministry, what makes us think we can do ours without him?" (*Spirit Filled Jesus*)
- "He voluntarily set aside the independent use of his divine attributes. He lived a genuinely human life in moment-by-moment dependence on the Spirit." (*Spirit Filled Jesus*)
- "We have substituted self-reliance for Spirit-dependence." (*Spirit Filled Jesus*)
- Luke's Spirit-chain traced from conception to resurrection: conceived by Spirit, baptism, wilderness, ministry launch, cross (Heb 9:14), resurrection (Rom 8:11). (*Spirit Filled Jesus*)








**Spirit's Revelatory Work**
- Inspiration (past: giving Scripture) vs. Illumination (present: opening eyes). (*Spirit Who Speaks*)
- Packer's "floodlight ministry" — the Spirit illuminates Christ, not Himself. (*Spirit Who Speaks*)
- "Experience without Scripture leads to confusion and death. Scripture without the Spirit leads to dead orthodoxy." (*Spirit Who Speaks*)
- "Same text, different results—the difference is the Spirit." (*Spirit Who Speaks*)

## Soteriology (Doctrine of Salvation)








**Core Position**: Substitutionary atonement integrated with Wright's covenant faithfulness. Propitiation understood through the mercy seat (hilasterion). Justification as courtroom verdict — declared righteous, not merely forgiven.








**⚠️ CRITICAL FRAMEWORK (from Rick directly):**
- NOT a 5-point Calvinist (reads Calvinists with respect but rejects TULIP as system)
- Holds prevenient grace + unlimited atonement
- Regeneration AFTER conviction and repentance (contra Grudem)
- Corporate election (God elects a people; individuals enter by faith)
- Takes Hebrews apostasy warnings seriously — gradual drift can break covenant
- NOT "once saved always saved" but also NOT "lose it every time you sin"
- Molinism (Craig) for sovereignty/freedom tension
- See memory/context/ricks-theological-framework.md for full framework








**Substitutionary Atonement**
- "The Cross: substitution — He died the death we deserved." (*Jesus Wonderful Savior*)
- "The full weight of divine justice fell on His own Son." (*Gold Standard*)
- "God didn't sweep sin under the rug. He dealt with it at the cross." (*Gold Standard*)
- "For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin" (2 Cor 5:21) deployed in context of Jesus standing with sinners at baptism. (*Spirit Filled Jesus*)








**Propitiation as Mercy Seat**
- Hilasterion = mercy seat on the Ark of the Covenant. Day of Atonement typology: blood applied between broken law below and holy presence above. (*Gold Standard*)
- "Jesus IS the mercy seat — where God and sinners meet." (*Gold Standard*)
- Addresses the propitiation/expiation scholarly debate directly — takes the propitiation side with Stott. (*Gold Standard*)








**Wright's Covenant Faithfulness**
- "Righteousness of God" understood through three Stott dimensions (attribute, activity, achievement) AND Wright's covenant faithfulness lens. (*Gospel's Power*)
- Wright's "galloping in on horseback with a last-minute reprieve" for the "But now!" of Romans 3:21. (*Gold Standard*)
- Rick integrates both without choosing sides — "characteristic Rick theological method." (*Gospel's Power* voice notes)








**Justification**
- "You don't leave the courtroom merely forgiven. You leave dressed in the perfection of Jesus." (*Gospel's Power*)
- Three terms unpacked: Justified (courtroom verdict), Grace (unearned), Redemption (marketplace, price paid). (*Gold Standard*)
- "The gospel isn't a ladder to climb. It's a gift to receive." (*Gold Standard*)
- Luther's breakthrough: "God doesn't just demand righteousness. He provides it." (*Gospel's Power*)








**Grace and Faith**
- "By grace you have been saved through faith... it is the gift of God." (*Jesus Wonderful Savior*)
- "Saving faith is trust. It's casting yourself on Jesus the way a drowning man grabs a lifeline." (*Jesus Wonderful Savior*)
- "From faith to faith — faith all the way down." (*Gospel's Power*)

## Sanctification








**Core Position**: Dying to self is surrender, not self-hatred. Willpower fails; only the Spirit's presence transforms. Metamorphosis (dissolution and re-creation), not reformation.








**Dying to Self as Surrender**
- "To truly live, you must die." (*Art of Dying to Live*)
- "Dying to self = deliberate surrender of will, rights, autonomy to God." (*Art of Dying to Live*)
- "Dying to self means you don't have to defend your reputation anymore. You're dead—you don't care!" (*Art of Dying to Live*)
- "The altar is not a place of loss; it is the place of encounter." (*Art of Dying to Live*)








**Willpower vs. Presence**
- The Parable of the Father's Footsteps: "Instantly, without anyone saying a word, the chaos vanished." The Presence silences the flesh; willpower alone cannot. (*Art of Dying to Live*)
- "This isn't willpower Christianity. This is Spirit-empowered living." (*Gospel-Shaped Living*)
- Thomas Chalmers: "The Expulsive Power of a New Affection" — "We do not die to self by staring at our sin and hating it; we die to self by staring at Jesus and loving Him." (*Art of Dying to Live*)








**Living Sacrifice / Transformation**
- Conformed (syschematizo, external mold) vs. Transformed (metamorphoo, internal change). (*Living Sacrifice*)
- Caterpillar/butterfly: "If you were to cut open a cocoon halfway through, you wouldn't find a half-caterpillar/half-butterfly. You would find soup." (*Art of Dying to Live*)
- "We don't reform the caterpillar into a butterfly. You can't train a caterpillar to fly. It has to go through death." (*Living Sacrifice*)
- "The problem with a living sacrifice is that it keeps crawling off the altar." (*Art of Dying to Live*)








**4-Step Protocol for Mortification**
1. Agree with the Verdict (name the sin honestly)
2. Prayer of Helplessness ("I have zero power to stop this desire right now")
3. Wield the Sword (quote specific Scripture at the temptation)
4. Starve and Re-direct (remove the food source, replace with something superior)
(*Art of Dying to Live*)

## Mission / Evangelism








**Core Position**: Incarnational approach modeled on Jesus. The gospel is obligation (opheiletēs), not option. Gospel is power (dynamis), not advice.








**Incarnational Approach**
- Jesus at the well: "Evangelism begins with being human, not impressive." (*Evangelism Jesus' Way*)
- "Start with listening, not lecturing. Meet people where they are, not where you want them to be." (*Evangelism Jesus' Way*)
- "Confront sin to reveal need, not to shame." (*Evangelism Jesus' Way*)
- Paul's name change from Saul — incarnational identification with those he's sent to. (*Model Missionary*)








**Obligation Theology (opheiletēs)**
- opheiletēs = debtor. Stott's two ways into debt: borrow from someone, or be entrusted with something for someone. "Paul didn't borrow from the Romans. Christ entrusted him with the gospel for them." (*Heart of Missionary*)
- "We don't own the gospel. We owe it." (*Heart of Missionary*)
- "Reluctance to share the gospel is not humility. It's unbelief." (*Heart of Missionary*)
- Three contrasting statements: "I am obligated... I am eager... I am not ashamed" vs. "Optional... reluctant... embarrassed." (*Heart of Missionary*, *Gospel's Power*)








**Gospel as Power**
- Dynamis — "The gospel is not advice. It is power." (*Gospel's Power*)
- "The gospel doesn't need our help. It needs our heralding." (*Gospel's Power*)
- "The gospel isn't Christianity 101 that we graduate from. It's the fuel for all of Christian life." (*Model Missionary*)
- "Everything else treats symptoms. The gospel performs surgery on the soul." (*Model Missionary*)








**Finney's Infinite Calculus**
- "The stakes aren't high. They're infinite." — souls exist forever, so the calculus of evangelism is infinite, not merely high. (*Heart of Missionary*)
- "One soul is worth more than all the gold in the world... because gold rusts. Buildings crumble. Empires fall. But souls exist forever." (*Heart of Missionary*)

## Worship








**Core Position**: Liturgical structure is valued (bell, candles, hymns, responsive readings, creed, Lord's Prayer). Sacramental awareness without being explicitly sacramental. Congregational participation is essential.








**Liturgical Structure**
- Full service order demonstrated: Bell → Prelude → Candles → Welcome → Hymns → Scripture Readings → Creed → Lord's Prayer → Offering → Benediction. (*Christmas Eve*, *Spirit Who Speaks*)
- Traditional hymn selection: "Be Thou My Vision," "Spirit of the Living God," "Silent Night," "Hark the Herald." (*Christmas Eve*, *Spirit Who Speaks*)
- Responsive Call to Worship adapted from Psalms. (*Spirit Who Speaks*)








**Benediction Craft**
- Original compositions tied to the sermon text: "May you be filled with the wonder of Mary, the obedience of Joseph, the joy of the angels..." (*Christmas Eve*)
- "Go now with the prophetic word as your lamp shining in the darkness." (*Spirit Who Speaks*)








**Doxological Unity**
- "Disunity mutes worship. Harmony amplifies it." (*Gospel-Shaped Living*)
- "With one voice glorify God" — unity is doxological; disunity is a worship problem, not just relational. (*Gospel-Shaped Living*)








---








## Prayer








**Core Position**: Prayer is Spirit-dependent, modeled by Jesus. Prayer is latreia (priestly service), not afterthought. Jesus' prayer life is the pattern for believers.








**Prayer as Latreia**
- "I serve with my spirit in the gospel" — latreia = priestly service. "Paul sees his prayer life as an act of worship. Not an afterthought." (*Heart of Missionary*)
- "Prayerless mission is just activism with a Christian label." (*Heart of Missionary*, echoed in *Praying Jesus*)








**Spirit-Dependent Model from Jesus**
- Ten lessons from Luke tracking Jesus' prayer life birth-to-cross. (*Praying Jesus*)
- "If the sinless Son depended on the Spirit, what makes us think we can manage without him?" (*Spirit Filled Jesus*, echoed in *Praying Jesus*)
- "Pagan prayer = manipulation; Christian prayer = submission." (*Praying Jesus*)
- "We don't wait until we're at the cross to surrender. We die to self in prayer." (*Praying Jesus*)








**Prayer as Transformation**
- "We are not just praying for successful ministries. We are being formed into Christ's image." (*Praying Jesus*)
- "Because Jesus was a man of prayer, He never got bitter." (*Praying Jesus*)
- 2 Cor 3:18 as anchor: "Beholding the glory of the Lord, we are being transformed." (*Praying Jesus*)

## Scripture








**Core Position**: Old covenant → new covenant continuity. Lectionary-based preaching. ESV as default translation. Scripture is more reliable than experience.








**Old Covenant → New Covenant Continuity**
- Spirit came and went under old covenant; remains permanently under new. (*Spirit Who Remains*)
- Shekinah cloud traced from Sinai → Tabernacle → Temple → Transfiguration. (*Spirit Who Speaks*)
- Day of Atonement typology applied to Christ as mercy seat. (*Gold Standard*)
- Isaiah 42:1 echoing the Father's words at baptism — "700 years in advance." (*Spirit Filled Jesus*)








**Lectionary-Based Preaching**
- Spirit series uses lectionary readings (Baptism of the Lord, Second Sunday after Epiphany, Transfiguration Sunday). (*Spirit Filled Jesus*, *Spirit Who Remains*, *Spirit Who Speaks*)
- Weaves four readings (OT, Psalm, Gospel, Epistle) into unified sermons. (*Spirit Filled Jesus*, *Spirit Who Speaks*)








**Scripture's Authority**
- "We have the prophetic word more fully confirmed" — Peter saw the Transfiguration but says Scripture is more certain. (*Spirit Who Speaks*)
- "The Bible is not man's word about God. It's God's word through men." (*Spirit Who Speaks*)
- "Carried along" (pheromenoi) — nautical term: human authors, divine superintendence. (*Spirit Who Speaks*)








**ESV Default**
- All sermon quotations use ESV. Memory verses specified as ESV. (*All sermons*)

## Government / Authority








**Core Position**: Dual citizenship — kingdom first, then country. Submission to government has limits (Acts 5:29). Not partisan, but prophetic.








**Dual Citizenship**
- "If you belong to Jesus, you carry two passports." (*Gospel-Shaped Living*)
- Written under Nero — "not a friendly government." (*Gospel-Shaped Living*)
- Officials as diakonos — same word for church ministers. (*Gospel-Shaped Living*)








**Submission with Limits**
- Acts 5:29 principle: "We must obey God rather than men." Hebrew midwives, Daniel cited as examples. (*Gospel-Shaped Living*)
- "We often get the rulers we deserve" — 1 Samuel 8 applied without partisanship. (*Gospel-Shaped Living*)
- "A nation that prioritizes comfort gets leaders who promise comfort." (*Gospel-Shaped Living*)








---








## Sin / Judgment








**Core Position**: Sin is a spiral, not a list. God's wrath operates by withdrawal ("gave them over"), not primarily by intervention. Both moral and immoral people stand condemned.








**Spiral Not List**
- Three-stage descent: impurity → dishonorable passions → debased mind. Three "gave them over." (*Spiral of Sin*)
- The vice list (Rom 1:29-31) includes "gossips, slanderers, arrogant, boastful" — "That's church people." (*Spiral of Sin*)
- Begins with bad worship, not bad behavior: "they did not honor him as God or give thanks." (*Spiral of Sin*)








**God's Wrath as Letting Go**
- "God's most terrifying judgment is not sending fire. It's stepping back." (*Spiral of Sin*)
- "Judgment by subtraction — God removes restraining grace." (*Spiral of Sin*)
- Stott: "God's wrath operates not by God's intervention but precisely by his not intervening." (*Spiral of Sin*)
- Wrath defined carefully: "Not divine tantrum — holy justice confronting evil." (*Spiral of Sin*)








**Moral and Immoral Both Condemned**
- Romans 2:1 springs the trap on the moralist: "The gavel you pound condemns you." (*Moralist's Trap*)
- "The pagan gives in to lust. The moralist calls it 'appreciating beauty.'" (*Moralist's Trap*)
- "The pagan gossips shamelessly. The moralist shares 'concerns' and 'prayer requests.'" (*Moralist's Trap*)
- Wright: "The line between good and evil runs, not between 'us' and 'them,' but down the middle of each of us." (*Spiral of Sin*)








**Applause for Evil**
- "When evil gets a standing ovation, the culture is terminal." (*Spiral of Sin*)
- Doing evil with conscience intact vs. celebrating evil with conscience seared — the latter is worse because it recruits. (*Spiral of Sin*)








---








## Repentance








**Core Position**: True repentance (godly sorrow) vs. false repentance (worldly sorrow) per 2 Cor 7:10. Direction matters more than intensity of feeling.








**True vs. False (2 Cor 7:10)**
- "Godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death." (*True & False Repentance*)
- "The question isn't whether you feel bad about your sin. The question is: What kind of bad do you feel? And which direction does it send you?" (*True & False Repentance*)
- "Worldly sorrow focuses on what sin has cost you. Godly sorrow focuses on how sin has grieved God." (*True & False Repentance*)








**Judas vs. Peter**
- "Both failed catastrophically. Both felt terrible. Only one survived." (*True & False Repentance*)
- "Same failure. Same sorrow. Different direction." (*True & False Repentance*)
- Judas: remorse → ran FROM Jesus → death. Peter: remorse → ran TO Jesus → restoration. (*True & False Repentance*)








**Hebrew/Greek Word Study**
- Shuv (OT) = turn/return. Metanoia (NT) = change of mind, transformation of values. (*True & False Repentance*)
- "True repentance is turning FROM sin AND turning TO God." Both parts required. (*True & False Repentance*)








**David as Model**
- "Against you, you only, have I sinned" — every sin at its core offends God (vertical breach primary). (*True & False Repentance*)
- "Create in me a clean heart" — asks for transformation, not just relief. (*True & False Repentance*)








**Repentance as Kinetic**
- "True repentance isn't just emotion. It's decision. It's movement. It's a change of direction that shows up in your actual life." (*True & False Repentance*)
- Physical action language: "got up," "went home," "jumped in the water and swam to Him." (*True & False Repentance*)
