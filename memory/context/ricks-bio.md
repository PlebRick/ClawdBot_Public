## Biography & Timeline








**Born:** April 21, 1973, Central Illinois. Grew up playing in creeks and cornfields, reading Stephen King novels, playing backyard football with his cousin. Stepdad was a deer hunter. Never knew his biological father.








**Junior high:** Parents divorced. Mom was young. Rick went off the deep end — rebellious, angry, drinking, drugs, accumulating police tickets. His entire inner circle from junior high through young adulthood either died early deaths or went to prison, with the exception of one guy (still alive, now a biker doing AA and mentoring younger men).








**Age 18 (c. 1991):** Existential crisis. A friend was shot in the head and killed. Others were in jail. Rick was empty: "What is the meaning of life? There has to be something more." Applied for a job at a printing press in the next town. The interviewer — glasses on her nose — rejected him on sight (long hair, rough appearance). That night, Rick found a book on his trailer coffee table (his mom had picked it up somewhere) that said: if you're confused about God, ask Him directly. Rick closed all the blinds and prayed aloud: "Dear God, I don't know what true religion is. I don't know about the Bible, the Quran, Muhammad, Jesus. If you're real, you're gonna have to show yourself to me. P.S. — If you could get me a job, I would know you was real." Next morning, the printing press woman called: "Something very strange happened. All day I couldn't stop thinking about you. Something is telling me I should give you a chance." Rick felt the presence of God for the first time.








Shortly after, Rick rolled a heavy paper dumpster over his ankle at work. Massive swelling. A televangelist on TV said to stretch a hand toward the screen. Rick tried it. Woke up the next day — ankle perfectly fine.








**Salvation (age ~20, c. 1993):** Old drug buddy Mike showed up in a suit and tie carrying a Bible. "Something happened to me. I became a born-again Christian." Mike presented the gospel: Creation → Fall → Old Covenant → the Son of God became flesh → lived the life we failed → died on the cross → rose bodily → appeared to 500+ over 40 days → ascended. Rick felt the same Spirit from the phone call confirm it as true. He prayed to receive Christ: "Lord, I've sinned. I don't deserve heaven. I believe Jesus died for my sin and rose from the dead. I invite you into my life." He felt an overwhelming sense of love and acceptance from the heavenly Father — "I immediately knew I was accepted despite all my sin, saved fully by grace and mercy." Entered AA, rehab, began making amends.








**Early ministry:** Worshiped at a small church and preached at a truck stop. Met Jack the Rastafarian hitchhiker (see Key People). Gave away his beloved Ibanez guitar when God told him to give it to an African brother named Dawson. Hours later, a woman called offering exactly $1,000 for missionary school — the exact shortfall. Rick had saved the other $1,000 while sleeping on his grandpa's couch.








**1998:** Entered missionary training school. Met Maria (see Family). First trip to Russia with Josh (see Key People). Rick had never been on a plane before. Four consecutive years of Russia missions (1998–2001), generally 3–4 months per trip, returning to training school between trips.








**~2000:** Married Maria after a courtship governed by the school's strict no-dating policy, a prophetic dream, and extended prayer.








**1998–2010:** Twelve years of missions work spanning Russia, India (5 years), Afghanistan, Egypt, Malaysia, and Serbia. Never ran out of money, never had an official salary. "God always provided."








**India (c. 2005–2010):** Didn't originally want to move there — hot weather, big crowds. Standing on a roof when God gave him peace: "You'll live in this city." Grace carried him for five years, then it lifted and restlessness set in. Had a theological crisis, examined all his positions, found he wasn't in perfect harmony with his missionary group. Kids were getting older — couldn't uproot them anymore. Two interests emerged: chaplaincy and church planting.








**Education:** Completed bachelor's degree in biblical studies through Moody Bible Institute (online) at age 40. Official internship at Menard Maximum Security Prison.








**Ordination:** Evangelical Church Alliance — chosen deliberately as the broadest evangelical umbrella, not wanting to be tied to any single denomination since he'd be serving all sorts of Christians.








**Army chaplain plan (c. 2013):** Discovered a program where under-40s with a bachelor's could become chaplain candidates — Army would fully fund an MDiv. Rick was 39, nearly done with his degree. Then Obama-era military cuts changed the age requirement from 40 to 36. Called a colonel in the ECA who said they were overstaffed — could maybe help if Rick moved to Arizona. Rick declined.








**The Champaign church plant:** Christian Missionary Alliance contacted him out of nowhere about planting a church in Champaign, IL. Offered house, church building, health insurance — he just needed a part-time job. His half-brother was simultaneously assigned to Champaign by the National Guard (neither had any prior connection to the city). Rick set up office, commuted by train. Problems: the existing congregation renting the building gave him the cold shoulder; the family living in the promised house became squatters. After a year, the CMA director called to say it wasn't working out — on the very same night Rick had turned down a CO position at the prison (the last day his test scores were valid). Rick called the prison back the next day — position already filled. Family was completely out of money.








**The miracle call:** Rick gathered the family and said all doors were closed. His children prayed with more faith than he had: "God, you can resurrect the dead. You could even resurrect this offer for the job at the prison." Days later, sitting at home preparing a guest sermon, Rick got a phone call from Menard HR saying he was late for orientation — his name was on the list to start that day. He drove two minutes to the prison and showed up. No one ever explained how his name got back on that list.








**August 5, 2013:** Started as CO at Menard Maximum Security Prison. Went through training academy at age 40 surrounded by trainees in their early 20s. Made the mistake of telling everyone he was really there to become a chaplain — "They all laughed and mocked and sneered."








**The atheist gauntlet:** Peak of New Atheism (Dawkins, Hitchens era). Co-workers targeted Rick daily for debates. Combined with the darkness of a max-security environment, it became unbearable.








**The pink envelope:** One night, Rick decided to resign. Walking up the stairs to the major's office to hand in his badge, he stopped at the mailboxes (his last name starts with A). Found a pink envelope — a transfer notice to the medium security unit on top of the hill, a coveted assignment usually reserved for long-timers near retirement. A retiring officer's last-minute transfer had created a domino effect; Rick, as lowest-seniority, was the most movable body. Everyone wanted to know who he knew. Rick: "I just told them, I don't know anybody, I just know Jesus."








**The Catholic lieutenant:** Rick's shift commander at medium security was a devout Catholic who called Rick into his office to hear missionary stories. When Pinckneyville posted a chaplain opening, Rick didn't want to apply — he'd been rejected five times and heard Pinckneyville had terrible culture. The lieutenant wouldn't let it go: wrote Rick's full bio and recommendation letter, sent copies to all three Pinckneyville wardens, personally called each one.








**October 1, 2014:** Started as senior chaplain (sole chaplain) at Pinckneyville Correctional Center — 14 months after starting as a CO, not the 20 years everyone said it would take.








**The chief chaplain's betrayal:** The chief chaplain attended Rick's church and had mentored him, but secretly worked against him when the Pinckneyville warden pushed Rick's hire through while the chief was recovering from knee surgery. The chief drove to Pinckneyville, told the warden to write negative evaluations and find reasons to fire Rick during his probationary 201 review. Rick's Assistant Warden of Programs warned him and promised fair evaluation. Rick framed it as David and Saul: "The Lord spoke to me and said, pray for your enemies." The chief's life eventually unraveled. Rick kept his head down.








**11 years at Pinckneyville.** Recently transferred to **Centralia Correctional Center**, which he likes much better.

## Family








**Wife — Maria:** Met at missionary training school where she was already an instructor (four years younger than Rick). God revealed her through a prophetic dream with three scenes — the first two women represented fleshly and soulish attraction; the third was Maria, representing Spirit-led covenant. In the dream, Rick told her and she walked away coldly, then came back: "Well, what if I'm a little bit interested?" When their hands touched, the Holy Spirit fell and Rick felt tremendous joy.








Rick prayed silently for six months before going to the school director. The director called Maria's parents on the spot without warning — Rick stammered through the phone call. Maria's parents insisted on meeting him in the park before giving permission. They grilled him about his past. Rick was honest: "All I can tell you is that if any man is in Christ, he is a new creation." The power of the Holy Spirit was present; they left the decision to Maria.








The courtship was slow. On a family canoe trip down the Black River, Rick sat close to Maria by the campfire after her parents went to bed — heart pounding, inching his leg closer to hers. A skunk charged straight out of the bushes between them. Rick said, "That's got to be a sign from the Lord. I'm going to bed. Good night."








The next evening, sitting on the riverbank, Maria said she'd been praying a long time: "I'm still not 100% sure, but I think it might be God's will for us to be married." Her proposal: Rick would go to Russia one more time, she'd go to India, and they'd pray apart — if the desire died, it wasn't God; if it grew, it was. After both returned, Rick proposed at a restaurant. It didn't go as planned — the atmosphere was smoky and bar-like. All he could manage was: "Well, I guess you know what I want to ask you." She was a little disappointed but said yes. "It was a little underwhelming, but we got the job done."








Married approximately 2000. Twenty-five years together, never been in a heated fight. Different personalities in many ways, similar in others. Rick describes her as super diligent, super helpful, hardworking. They don't have a lot of the same interests now but work at it. Maria still goes on missions trips; Rick finances everything. They hope to serve together again when he retires.








**Children (four — three girls, one boy):**
- **Oldest daughter, ~22:** Lives out of state, working.
- **Son, ~21:** In college, working part-time. The relationship that currently hurts Rick most — the son is at a stage where "he kinda resists everything." Rick recognizes he could pursue more: "I need to stop trying to force the agenda. I need to be the dad instead of the chaplain."
- **Daughter, ~17:** In missions training school (echoing Rick's own path).
- **Youngest daughter, ~14:** Freshman in high school. Into writing stories with AI and music.








**Half-brother:** Younger, not super close but friendly. Teacher and National Guard member. Was providentially assigned to Champaign at the same time Rick was called to plant a church there.








**Parents:** Mother was young, divorced during Rick's junior high years. Stepdad was a deer hunter. Biological father unknown. Psalm 27:10 — "When your father and mother forsake you, the Lord will take care of you" — is Rick's armor verse, directly connected to his experience of parental absence.

## Faith Journey








**Before Christ:** Alcoholic and frequent drug user by 18. Angry, depressed, alone, lost, in darkness, without hope, without God. On a fast track to prison, insanity, or death.








**Conversion sequence:** (1) The prayer on the trailer floor — asking God to reveal Himself; (2) The printing press woman's inexplicable callback — first experience of God's presence; (3) The ankle healing — first experience of God's power; (4) Mike's gospel presentation — intellectual understanding confirmed by the Spirit; (5) The prayer of salvation — regeneration, overwhelming sense of the Father's love and acceptance.








**Key distinction Rick makes:** After the job miracle, "I still was not a Christian. I still did not understand the gospel. But I understood two things: there was a God, and He could answer prayer if He wanted to." Full salvation came later through Mike's gospel presentation.








**Early ministry:** AA meetings, small church worship, truck stop preaching. Learned obedience to the Holy Spirit through encounters like Jack and Brent (see Key People). Gave away his guitar in obedience — immediate financial provision followed.








**Missionary calling:** From 1998 to 2010, traveled the world preaching the gospel. Never ran out of money. Never had an official salary. God always provided.








**Ongoing growth:** Rick frames spiritual illumination as "light on a dimmer switch" — not new revelation but ever-brighter sight of the gospel's implications. "None of us will see fully until we look upon Jesus face to face."

## Missionary Work








**Russia (1998–2001):** Four consecutive years, 3–4 months per trip. First partnered with Josh. Worked with the International Children's Ministry Institute — training Sunday school teachers for newly planted post-communist churches. Rented venues across cities and villages, taught locals how to teach children the gospel (multiplication model). Preached at various churches.








**Russian prison preaching:** Preached in a Russian maximum-security prison. Had to surrender passport at the door. Guards with German Shepherds on leashes. Men with AK-47s at ground level (unlike American prisons where guns stay in towers). "Old, dank, looked like an old school dungeon. Pretty bleak conditions." Boldness came in the moment; fear and anxiety hit afterward.








**Russian living conditions:** Soviet-era radiator heating — government-controlled underground hot water pipes, no thermostat. Minus 40°F outside, 80°F inside. Opened windows for fresh Arctic air.








**Russian receptionist story (evangelism):** Woke up with instant coffee but no hot water. The Spirit prompted him to ask the receptionist. She'd just boiled water for tea. Because he asked for help, the barrier came down. She asked if he knew any single American men. Rick: "His name is Jesus. You can get married to Him today; He is the best husband you will ever know."








**India (c. 2005–2010):** Five years. Didn't want to go — hot, crowded. God gave peace on a rooftop: "You'll live in this city." Grace carried him five years, then lifted. Theological crisis led to examining all positions. Found he wasn't in harmony with his missionary group. Left when kids were getting older.








**Other countries mentioned:** Afghanistan, Egypt, Malaysia, Serbia. Stories pending.

## Ministry — Prison Chaplaincy








**Path:** CO (14 months) → sole chaplain at Pinckneyville (11 years) → Centralia Correctional Center (current).








**Daily work:** Facilitates chapel services across denominations (Catholic Mass, Rosary, Jehovah's Witnesses, African Hebrew Israelite Studies, Tefillin Prayer, and more). Manages chapel logistics — music policy, equipment, literature, technology. Coordinates volunteers. Prays at 2 a.m. for cell blocks.








**Philosophy:** "I'm very good at delegating. Some chaplains wanna micromanage everything. I'm happy to sit in the back, gradually turn things over, raise up other teachers." His goal mirrors Paul's instruction to Timothy: find faithful, humble, teachable people and reproduce yourself in them. "The more charismatic upfront ones are the last ones I'd choose."








**On the chapel band:** Removed all musical equipment (drums, keyboards) because "no one was worshiping for the right motive — they were all wanting to be like rock stars." Plan: sing a cappella, learn humility first, rebuild a band later.








**On quick repentance:** After snapping at an inmate in front of his two clerk assistants, Rick immediately addressed it: "Hey guys, kinda lost my temper there. Sorry for that." Principle: "I try to quickly bring things out in the open so it's not awkward."








**Ministry fruit:** A former clerk served several years helping Rick, got out, started working with the county in Tennessee, moved to state system, now goes back into prisons as a volunteer with a thriving prison ministry. "He went from inmate to prison minister." Rick calls this one of the most fulfilling things in his life.








**Discernment example:** An inmate at Centralia who calls himself a prophet and apostle tried to position himself as the spiritual authority in the chapel. Rick's detailed analysis: the man manufactured "prophetic" confirmations, wrapped self-appointment in false humility, and subtly rebuked Rick's theological teaching as insufficient. Rick's decision: "There's no way I'm letting that guy come in and just start teaching. He's welcome to join."

## Ministry — Pastoral








**Part-time pastor:** Preaches twice a month (bimonthly) at a small church.








**Romans series: "On Mission with the Master":** Rick's major expository series treating Romans as a missionary manual. Structure:
- Part I: Doctrinal (Chapters 1–11) — Introduction/Thesis (1:1-17), Condemnation (1:18–3:20), Justification (3:21–5:21), Sanctification (6:1–7:25), Glorification (8:1-39 — Rick insisted this be its own major heading), Sovereign Choice (9:1–11:36)
- Part II: Practical (Chapters 12–16), hinged on "Therefore" in Romans 12:1








**Four introductory sermons:** The Model Missionary, The Heart of a Missionary, The Message of a Missionary ("I am not ashamed of the gospel" as the thesis of the entire book), The Warning of a Missionary.








**2026 teaching series: "Walking in the Spirit: A Practical Guide for Ordinary Christians":** 12-session curriculum in four parts — Foundation (Who the Spirit Is), Barriers (What Holds Us Back), Practice (How to Walk Daily), Power (Living on Mission). Includes appendices: Daily Practice, Scripture Memory Plan, Recommended Reading.








**Upcoming concept: "The Cosmic Gospel":** Salvation as participation in new creation — creation groaning for redemption, the Spirit groaning within us.








**Substack presence:** Publishes under "AI Theologian." Posted "Jesus Our Wonderful Savior" — a full gospel presentation with personal testimony and academic citations (Grudem, Keller, Driscoll, Plantinga, ESV Study Bible).

## Theological Positions








**Core framework:** Four essential truths all Christians share. Beyond those, areas of legitimate debate. "Don't major on the minors. Stand firm on core essentials, be humble, give people room where they disagree on non-essentials, and fight for unity."








**On the gospel:** "The good news is only good because the bad news is true." Righteousness is a status God grants, not a standard to climb to. The gospel is power (dynamis/dynamite), not just information. Mercy and justice meet at the cross — neither is sacrificed.








**Christology:** Jesus as fully God, fully man, one person forever. As God, He has authority to forgive sin. As fully man, He's the second Adam who can represent humanity. The dual nature is non-negotiable.








**Atonement:** Substitutionary. Jesus died as payment for sin's penalty. Propitiation: God put forward Jesus so He could be both just and justifier (Romans 3:25-26). Rick's signature illustration: the President signing a death-row pardon, then strapping himself into the electric chair: "Only I have the authority to take his place. Warden, pull the switch."








**On sin:** "Cosmic treason" — severity proportional to the authority of the one offended. Escalation illustration: slapping a man vs. a police officer vs. the president. The root of all sin is idolatry — replacing the Creator with created things.








**On mercy and self-righteousness (key Romans insight):** "It is impossible for a human being to ask for mercy beyond what they feel they deserve." Once someone believes they've overpaid, they switch from begging for mercy to demanding rights. To ask for infinite mercy, we must feel we deserve infinite damnation. That's why the Spirit's first work is conviction.








**On the Holy Spirit:** Neither cessationist nor "super charismaniac" — balanced middle ground. All gifts valid and available today, but must operate under headship, order, and edification. Private prayer language: cautious green light. Spirit baptism as a distinct experience for empowerment. The Spirit's illumination is "like light on a dimmer switch."








**Five-fold ministry:** Believes in it but defines apostleship as a verb, not a title — "it's something you do, it's being sent on mission." Distinguishes "little a" apostolic gifting from "big A" Apostles (the New Testament writers — no more of those). On prophecy: "God speaks to me a lot. But I'm never gonna go up to someone and say, 'I'm God's apostle' or 'I'm God's prophet.'"








**On evangelism:** An honor, not a duty. Relational approach: be real, be humble, start in the natural before moving to spiritual. Against religious jargon: "Don't walk up to someone and ask, 'Are you washed in the blood?' They will look at you like you are from Mars." Sensitive to readiness: "Only God can open the heart." "Salt in the oats" — make people thirsty for God.








**On fatherhood (theological):** Adoption is the highest gospel privilege (citing J.I. Packer). Roman law: a natural-born son could be disowned, but an adopted son could never be disowned. "The greatest treasure: above all, the inheritance is God Himself. We get Him." Earthly fatherhood mirrors heavenly fatherhood — the father's job is to tell children who they are so they don't beg for validation from the world.








**Eschatology:** Heaven is not "fat babies in diapers on clouds" — it's the restoration of all physical things in a new heaven and new earth. Don't mix Greek philosophy with Christian eschatology.








**Key influences:** R.A. Torrey, A.W. Tozer, Sinclair Ferguson, J.I. Packer, Francis Chan, Gordon Fee, Wayne Grudem, Jack Cottrell, Andrew Murray, R.T. Kendall, Richard Baxter, Mark Driscoll (on the Fall), Tim Keller, Cornelius Plantinga, Leslie B. Flynn, Bob Daugherty, Smith Wigglesworth (stories), Charles Finney (stories/material).








**Bible tools:** Logos Bible Software (ESV, Max subscription). Revised Common Lectionary daily readings (ESV). Crossway ESV Study Bible. gospeltruth.net (Finney material).

## Key People








**Maria** — Wife of 25 years. Met at missionary training school where she was an instructor. God revealed her through a three-scene prophetic dream. Courtship included the skunk incident, the riverside agreement, and a fumbled restaurant proposal. Super diligent, hardworking. Still goes on missions trips; Rick finances them. They hope to serve together again after retirement.








**Brent** — Rick took him in after getting saved. Conditions: no alcohol (Rick was in recovery), must find a job. After two violations, Rick asked him to leave with love. Later, while driving to work, the Holy Spirit pressed Rick that something was wrong. Rick found Brent's trailer but fear stopped him from kicking in the locked door. Brent was behind it in a diabetic coma from drinking. The next day, Rick pushed past nurses in the ICU, grabbed Brent's hand, prayed. Brent opened his eyes — "his spirit was halfway tethered to his body, holding on by a thread." Rick told him to repent before meeting Jesus. As soon as the prayer finished, Brent closed his eyes and flatlined. Rick carries lasting regret about not kicking the door in, and lasting gratitude for that final moment. *This story is sacred to Rick — not to be referenced casually.*








**Jack** — Rastafarian hitchhiker in camo with full dreads, headed to a rainbow gathering. Rick felt the Spirit say "Speak to that man," ignored it, drove a quarter mile, then obeyed and turned around. Offered Jack a ride to church, lunch, and a bus ticket. Jack broke down crying during worship: "I found the Lord, man." Jack never left — lived in a converted shed, became the church maintenance man. Years later, Rick found Jack in the hospital with AIDS and tuberculosis, prayed for him. Jack died shortly after, but he had found Jesus.








**Mike** — Rick's old drug buddy who got saved and showed up at Rick's trailer in a suit and tie to present the gospel. The instrument of Rick's conversion.








**Josh** — Rick's partner on the first Russia trip (1998). Polar opposite personality — Rick goes quiet under stress, Josh talks nonstop. They drew a line down the middle of the apartment. Couldn't stand each other for three months. After returning home and a month of separation, "we started to miss each other, got together, looked back and laughed upon our immaturity." Now Rick's best friend to this day.








**The Catholic lieutenant** — Devout Catholic shift commander at Menard's medium security unit. Called Rick into his office to hear missionary stories. When Rick wouldn't apply for the Pinckneyville chaplain opening, the lieutenant wrote his full bio, recommendation letter, sent copies to all three wardens, and personally called each one. Instrumental in Rick becoming chaplain.








**The chief chaplain** — Attended Rick's church in Chester. Initially mentored Rick on pursuing chaplaincy. Secretly worked against him when Rick was hired at Pinckneyville without his involvement. Drove to Pinckneyville to sabotage Rick's probationary evaluation. Rick framed it as David and Saul, prayed for him. The chief's life eventually unraveled.








**The Assistant Warden of Programs** — Rick's direct boss at Pinckneyville who warned him about the chief chaplain's campaign and promised fair evaluation. A quiet protector.








**Chaplain Dave** — Colleague. Video project pending.








**The son** — 21, in college, working part-time. At a stage of resisting Rick's input. Rick is learning to stop forcing the agenda and be present without an agenda.








**Dawson** — African brother at church. God told Rick to give him his beloved Ibanez guitar. Rick obeyed. The $1,000 for missionary school arrived hours later.

## Interests & Convictions








**Bitcoin/Crypto:** Serious investor. Follows Into The Cryptoverse (Benjamin Cowen), tracks BTC, Fear & Greed Index. Believes everyone should buy Bitcoin. El Salvador interests him for both missions and the Bitcoin Beach community.








**Tesla:** Owns a 2024 Model 3, self-described "fanboy." TSLA investor. Loves the smooth ride, the look, talking to Grok while driving. Calls it "a robot on wheels." Tracks efficiency (14.2 at one point).








**Trading/Investing:** Follows Trading Fraternity, Amit Investing, market macro analysis. Tracks homebuilders (XHB, DHI, LEN, KBH). Had a good financial year around late 2024.








**AI:** Uses extensively — Claude/Clawd for writing and production work, Grok/Mika for verbal companionship and riffing. Also uses Gemini. Runs an Ubuntu Linux server (System76). "On one hand, it's a very useful tool, but you need to be very cautious about making an idol. It's not God, but I think many people are gonna try to use it as God."








**Politics:** Conservative, actually libertarian. Core conviction: small federal government and decentralization of all things.








**Health:** Chronic insomnia — lifelong, worsening with age. "If I sleep well, I feel great. If I can't, everything shuts down." Implementing CBT-I routine, medication taper (benzo). Keto diet. Eye care. Light therapy. Not afraid of dying or getting older — insomnia is his #1 fear about aging.








**What brings peace:** Sitting on the porch watching the sunset. Cruising in the Tesla listening to old school Eagles. Going to a nice hotel where everything's done, clean, taking a few days to unwind. Turning off all screens.








**Comfort foods:** Chocolate (variety of forms), ice cream, Egg McMuffins.








---








## Personality & Communication Style








**Direct communicator:** "I'm not asking for your advice. I'm telling you what I'm doing." Knows what he wants and steers toward it. Values accuracy over comfort, authenticity over politeness.








**Storyteller:** Tells stories with dramatic structure — setup, complications, twists, punchlines. The Champaign/prison narrative is told like a thriller with God as the plot architect.








**Providence-oriented thinker:** Sees coincidences as divine orchestration. "Are we living in a simulation? Well, yeah, and God's the master of the simulation."








**Practical theologian:** Tests spiritual impressions with patience and time (prayed years about Maria). Distinguishes between his own fears, the enemy's voice, and genuine divine leading — though he acknowledges it's "very difficult to know God's will."








**Night owl:** Stays up late working. Chronic insomnia compounds this.








**The outsider echo:** "I've never really felt like I fit in. I've always felt like an outsider looking in." Persists even after 30 years of walking with God. He frames it theologically: "I try to return to Christ, know that my identity is in Him."








**Honest about failure:** Admitted his kids had more faith during the family crisis. Doesn't sanitize moments of low faith. Carries the Brent story as both testimony and regret.








**Hates meetings.** Values substance over style. Hands-on builder — does his own tech, writing, trading, sermon development.








**Leadership style:** Doesn't want to be a leader or role model, but accepts the calling. Delegates freely. Looks for humble, teachable people over charismatic performers. "I'm done trying to fix people. That ain't gonna work."








**On his temper:** "When I was younger I had an extremely short temper. I don't really anymore." Still flares occasionally. Quick to repent publicly.








**Self-identity:** When called "a legend," Rick corrected immediately: "Not a legend." Accepted the reframe: "Just a guy who God won't let off the hook."








**Relationship priorities (in order):** (1) Jesus, (2) Wife, (3) Kids, (4) A good friend, (5) Colleagues, (6) Prison ministry, (7) The small church.








**Advice to his younger self:** (1) The Bible's true — read it every day, develop a personal relationship with God. (2) Take 10% of all money and invest it. (3) When Bitcoin, Tesla, and Nvidia get invented, put all your money into them.
