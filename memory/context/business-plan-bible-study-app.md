# Business Plan: AI-Powered Bible Study & Theological Resource Platform
*Created: 2026-01-27 | Status: CONCEPT / PLANNING*
*Name: SACRED — (existing open source app, transitioning to private/commercial)*


---


## The Vision


An AI-powered Bible study platform that thinks like a pastor, not a programmer. Built on 25 years of curated theological reading (7,500+ books), delivering commentary, sermon prep, liturgical resources, systematic theology, and theological reference — all through an intelligent interface that understands how pastors, students, and laypeople actually study Scripture.


**This is not another chatbot with a Bible.** This is a pastor's brain in an app — decades of reading, distilled and synthesized, available on demand.

## Founder Advantages (The Moat)


| Advantage | Why It Matters |
|-----------|---------------|
| 7,500+ curated digital books (25 years) | Proprietary knowledge base no competitor can replicate overnight |
| Working pastor (liturgical tradition) | Knows what pastors actually need vs. what tech people think they need |
| Prison chaplain experience | Understands accessibility, simplicity, reaching underserved populations |
| Theological depth | Driscoll, Stott, Finney, Wright, Craig, Keller, Comfort — broad evangelical/reformed range |
| AI infrastructure already built | Already runs a personal AI assistant (Clawd) — technical foundation exists |
| Deep focus ability | Can grind for hours building, curating, training — the work most people can't do |
| Not public-facing (feature, not bug) | The product speaks for itself — no personality cult required |


---


## Target Market


### Primary: Pastors & Church Leaders
- **Pain point:** Sermon prep takes 10-20 hours/week. Existing tools (Logos, Accordance) are expensive ($500-5,000+), bloated, and designed by engineers not pastors.
- **What they'd pay:** $15-30/month (fraction of Logos cost)
- **Size:** ~400,000 Protestant pastors in the US alone


### Secondary: Seminary Students & Bible Study Leaders
- **Pain point:** Drowning in reading, need synthesis and connections across sources. Can't afford Logos on a student budget.
- **What they'd pay:** $10-15/month (student tier)
- **Size:** ~70,000 seminary students + millions of small group leaders


### Tertiary: Serious Laypeople
- **Pain point:** Want to go deeper than a devotional app but don't know where to start. Intimidated by academic tools.
- **What they'd pay:** $8-12/month
- **Size:** Massive — tens of millions of churchgoing Christians who want depth


### Future: Prison Ministry / Chaplaincy Edition
- **Pain point:** Inmates and chaplains have almost zero access to quality theological resources. Everything is simplified to the point of being useless.
- **Unique angle:** Rick is one of very few people who understands BOTH the theology AND the prison context
- **Model:** Could be grant-funded, donated by churches, or institutional subscription

## Competitive Landscape


| Competitor | Price | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------------|
| **Logos Bible Software** | $500-5,000+ one-time | Massive library, powerful search | Expensive, bloated, steep learning curve, no AI |
| **Accordance** | $50-600+ | Clean UI, Mac-native | Smaller library, no AI, still pricey |
| **YouVersion Bible App** | Free | Huge user base, reading plans | Surface-level, no commentary depth, ad-supported |
| **Blue Letter Bible** | Free | Good original language tools | Dated UI, no AI, limited commentary |
| **ChatGPT / Grok / Claude** | $20/month | General AI, can discuss theology | No curated sources, hallucinations, no theological framework, generic |
| **Grok Bible mode** | Free w/ X | Accessible | Not built for serious study |


### Our Differentiation
- **AI + curated theological library** — not generic AI, not static reference tool. The synthesis.
- **Pastor-built** — designed by someone who actually preps sermons and leads Bible studies
- **Affordable** — $10-20/month vs. $500+ for Logos
- **Liturgical awareness** — knows the church calendar, lectionary, seasons
- **Conservative theological framework** — not theologically liberal AI hedging

**Break-even on Rick's $100K goal: ~700 subscribers at average $12/month**


---


## Legal & Copyright Strategy


### What We CANNOT Do
- Upload copyrighted books directly into the app
- Reproduce substantial portions of copyrighted works
- Claim others' commentary as our own


### What We CAN Do
- **Create original content informed by Rick's 25 years of reading** — this is how every theologian works. You read 100 commentaries and write your own synthesis. That's scholarship, not plagiarism.
- **Train the AI on Rick's voice and theological framework** — the AI learns Rick's perspective, not someone else's copyrighted text
- **Reference and cite** — "As N.T. Wright argues in _Surprised by Hope_..." is fair use
- **Use public domain sources** — pre-1928 works, church fathers, classic commentaries (Calvin, Luther, Wesley, Spurgeon, etc.) are all free
- **Write original commentaries, dictionaries, and liturgies** — AI-assisted, Rick-directed
- **Build original sermon outlines and study guides** — transformative, original works


### The Process
1. Rick reads/has read the books (done — 25 years of it)
2. Rick's theological perspective is captured and trained into the AI (Professor mode)
3. The AI produces original content that reflects Rick's synthesis — not copied text
4. All output is original, Rick-voiced, AI-assisted scholarship
5. Public domain works can be included directly (massive classical library)


**Recommended:** Consult an IP attorney before launch to review the content pipeline. Budget: ~$1,000-2,000 for initial consultation.


---


## Technical Architecture (High Level)


### Knowledge Base
- **Public domain theological works** — digitized, indexed, searchable (Calvin, Luther, Wesley, Spurgeon, church fathers, etc.)
- **Rick's original content** — commentaries, sermon notes, study guides, theological dictionary entries
- **Rick's voice model** — trained on Rick's writing/preaching style for Professor mode
- **Structured Bible data** — cross-references, original languages, lectionary calendar


### Tech Stack (ALREADY BUILT — SACRED v0.3.0)
| Layer | Technology | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Frontend | React 18, Vite, CSS Modules | ✅ Built |
| Rich Text Editor | Tiptap | ✅ Built |
| Backend | Express 5 | ✅ Built |
| Database | SQLite (better-sqlite3) | ✅ Built |
| Desktop | Electron (Mac .dmg) | ✅ Built |
| AI Integration | MCP Server (72 tools!) | ✅ Built |
| Docker/Web Hosting | Multi-stage Dockerfile | ✅ Built |
| Auth | Session-based password | ✅ Built |
| Bible Translations | ESV (API) + WEB (offline/bundled) | ✅ Built |
| Search | SQLite FTS5 full-text | ✅ Built |
| Tests | 1,174 tests | ✅ Built |


### What Still Needs Building (For Commercial)
- **AI-powered study responses** — RAG pipeline over theological knowledge base (Claude API + vector DB)
- **Subscription/payment system** — Stripe integration
- **User accounts** — multi-user auth (currently single-user password)
- **Audio sermon generation** — ElevenLabs integration
- **Content loading pipeline** — bulk import from Rick's 7,500 books
- **Mobile optimization** — PWA or native apps
- **Landing page / marketing site**


### Build Cost Estimate
| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Domain + hosting (year 1) | $200-500 |
| AI API costs (development) | $100-300/month |
| Stripe fees | 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction |
| IP attorney consultation | $1,000-2,000 |
| Design (logo, branding) | $200-500 (AI-assisted) |
| ElevenLabs subscription | Already active |
| **Total startup** | **~$2,000-4,000** |


No inventory. No office. No employees (initially). Just Rick + Clawd + the library + ElevenLabs voice.

## Go-To-Market Strategy (No Public Face Required)


### How to Get Users Without Being an Influencer


1. **SEO content** — AI-generated Bible study articles, commentary, theological explainers → ranks on Google → drives organic traffic. No face, just content.


2. **Pastor forums and groups** — Facebook groups, Reddit r/pastors, r/theology, denominational forums. Share the tool, not yourself.


3. **Church partnerships** — reach out to 10-20 churches directly. Offer free trial for their staff. Word of mouth among pastors is the strongest channel in ministry.


4. **Seminary student ambassadors** — free accounts for seminary students who share with classmates. Students become pastors who become paying subscribers.


5. **Theological blog / newsletter** — written by the AI in Professor voice. Builds authority without Rick's face or name (pen name works fine).


6. **Product Hunt / Indie Hackers launch** — one-time visibility burst in the tech/startup community.


7. **Prison ministry network** — Rick's existing connections. Chaplains talk to each other.

## Name: SACRED ✅
- Already exists as Rick's open source app
- Transitioning to private/commercial
- Perfect name — trustworthy, theological, not gimmicky, not a tech startup name
- ⚠️ **Legal consideration:** Need to review the current open source license. If it's MIT/Apache, anyone can fork the current version. Options:
  - Fork it privately, build commercial features on top (allowed under most OSS licenses)
  - Change license going forward (new code is proprietary)
  - The open source version becomes the "community edition" and the commercial version is "SACRED Pro" or similar
  - Consult IP attorney on cleanest path


---


## Answered Questions (2026-01-27)


1. **Book format:** Can export 100 pages at a time in rich text, HTML, etc. — ready to feed into AI for knowledge base building.
2. **Public domain %:** Still TBD — need to catalog.
3. **Sermon content:** Has sermon outlines AND manuscripts, actively developing more. ✅
4. **Denomination:** TBD — broad evangelical/liturgical blend likely.
5. **Beta testers:** TBD — Rick likely has church connections.
6. **Brand vs. personal name:** Going with brand name. **App already exists: SACRED** (currently open source, will transition to private/commercial).
7. **Budget:** TBD.


## Key Assets Already in Hand


| Asset | Status | Value |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **SACRED app** | Existing open source codebase | Head start on development — don't build from zero |
| **7,500 digital books** | Exportable (100 pages at a time, rich text/HTML) | Knowledge base ready to extract |
| **Sermon outlines & manuscripts** | Active and growing | Voice training + content pipeline |
| **ElevenLabs subscription** | Active | AI-generated audio sermons in Rick's custom voice |
| **Custom AI voice** | Deep, conservative-sounding voice already created | Audio sermons, potential audiobook content, app narration |
| **Clawd (AI assistant)** | Running, capable of content generation | Professor mode for theological writing |
| **YouTube channel potential** | Rick willing to create one | Audio sermons + app promotion channel |


## Revenue Channels (Expanded)


Original subscription model PLUS:
- **Audio sermon library** — AI voice narrating original sermons (ElevenLabs) → premium content
- **YouTube channel** — audio sermons as videos (simple visual + AI voice) → free content funnel driving app subscriptions
- **Podcast potential** — same audio content, distributed as a podcast → another funnel


The YouTube/podcast angle is brilliant because:
- Rick doesn't need to be on camera — AI voice + simple visuals (text on screen, Scripture graphics)
- Content IS the marketing — each sermon/study is both a product AND a promotional piece
- Builds audience that converts to paid app subscribers
- SEO juice from YouTube drives organic discovery


## Existing SACRED Codebase (v0.3.0 — reviewed 2026-01-27)


**Repo:** github.com/PlebRick/SACRED (public, MIT license) + private version exists
**Last update:** 2026-01-25 (2 days ago!)
**Tests:** 1,174 tests


### Already Built ✅
- Full Bible reader (WEB offline + ESV via API)
- Rich text note editor (Tiptap) with verse-range notes
- 3 note types: Notes, Commentary, Sermons
- Hierarchical topic/category system
- Inline tagging (Illustration, Application, Key Point, Quote, Cross-Reference)
- Browse by tag with search
- Full-text search (SQLite FTS5)
- Systematic Theology integration (Grudem-based, 4,800+ scripture refs)
- Doctrine ↔ Note bidirectional linking (`[[ST:Ch32]]` syntax)
- Sermon series management
- Illustration duplicate detection
- Study session tracking
- 72 MCP tools for Claude AI integration
- Session-based auth for web hosting
- Docker deployment (Railway/Render ready)
- Mac desktop app (Electron .dmg)
- Export/Import backup system (v4)
- Dark/light theme
- Multiple Bible translations


### Not Yet Built (Needed for Commercial)
- AI-powered conversational study (RAG over knowledge base)
- Multi-user accounts with individual subscriptions
- Payment/subscription system (Stripe)
- Content pipeline for importing Rick's 7,500 books
- ElevenLabs audio sermon generation
- Mobile apps (iOS/Android) or PWA
- Landing page / marketing site
- Reading plans (in backlog)
- Audio Bible integration (in backlog)


### License Situation
- Currently **MIT license** — anyone can fork and use it
- Strategy options:
  1. Keep open source version as "SACRED Community" → build commercial features in private repo ("SACRED Pro")
  2. Change license on new versions (allowed — MIT only covers existing code)
  3. "Open core" model — free base, paid premium features
- The private version Rick already has may already be the commercial fork


## Open Questions (Remaining)
1. What percentage of the 7,500 books are public domain vs. copyrighted?
2. What denominational tradition should SACRED default to? (Broad evangelical? Specifically liturgical?)
3. Does Rick have existing relationships with churches that could be beta testers?
4. Budget for the first 6 months of development?
5. ~~Where is the SACRED repo?~~ ✅ github.com/PlebRick/SACRED
6. ~~What does the current SACRED app do?~~ ✅ See above — it's a full Bible study app at v0.3.0
7. Has Rick already built the ElevenLabs voice clone, or is it a stock voice?
8. ~~What's in the private version that's different from the public one?~~ ✅ **ANSWERED:** Private version has full Grudem Systematic Theology embedded for Rick's personal study. Public version does not. Otherwise same codebase.
9. ~~What's the Grudem systematic theology content's copyright status?~~ ✅ **ANSWERED:** Rick has a personal use license. Grudem's full text is embedded in the PRIVATE version only for Rick's personal study. The PUBLIC/commercial version does NOT include Grudem's copyrighted text. Commercial version will use: (a) Rick's original systematic theology content, (b) public domain classics (Calvin, Luther, Wesley, Spurgeon, church fathers, Hodge, pre-1928 works), (c) AI-generated original commentary.
10. **NEW:** What public domain systematic theologies should we prioritize for the commercial version?

## Rick's Design Notes (2026-01-27)


### UX
- Current SACRED UX is a start but **not polished enough** — needs significant refinement before commercial launch
- This is a priority — pastors won't pay for rough UX no matter how good the content is


### Content Strategy — ALL ORIGINAL
Every tool included in the subscription must have an **original version written by us** (AI-assisted, Rick-directed):
- Original commentary (book by book)
- Original expositional sermons
- Original sermon outlines
- Original illustrations library
- Original theological dictionary
- Original systematic theology
- Other tools TBD


This is the core work and the core moat. No one else will have this.


### AI Integration Strategy
- MCP tools exist (72) but **most pastors won't know how to use MCP**
- Keep MCP for power users who know Claude Desktop/Code
- **Build an in-app AI chat** — conversational interface that pastors can just talk to
- The AI chat queries the knowledge base (RAG) and responds in Professor voice
- This is the killer feature that separates SACRED from Logos/Accordance


### Public Domain Strategy — "Modernized Classics"
- Rick's observation: **people love to have public domain works but barely read them**
- Solution: Embed originals in the library BUT use AI to generate **modern language versions**
- Part or all of each work, modernized for readability while preserving theological substance
- This is a unique content play — nobody else is doing AI-modernized classics at scale


### Priority Public Domain Authors
- Charles Finney
- Charles Spurgeon
- Augustine
- Church Fathers (broadly)
- John Calvin
- Jonathan Edwards
- Matthew Henry
- Puritans (broadly)
- John Wesley
- George Whitefield
- Many others TBD


### Content Production Pipeline
1. Rick identifies source material (public domain work or his own reading synthesis)
2. AI (Clawd/Professor mode) drafts modern version or original content
3. Rick reviews, edits, approves — his theological judgment is the quality gate
4. Approved content enters SACRED's database
5. AI chat can reference and synthesize from all approved content


## Decisions Made (2026-01-27)


| Decision | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **First commentary book** | Romans — Rick is deeply immersed in this material, has Wright + Stott Romans exports, preached Romans 1:1-7 recently |
| **Brand name** | SACRED — existing app name, already built |
| **No gig work** | Rick has a good day job; this is about owning a business, not replacing income immediately |
| **All original content** | Every tool (commentary, sermons, outlines, illustrations, dictionary, systematic theology) must have an original version — this is the moat |
| **In-app AI chat required** | MCP stays for power users, but commercial product needs conversational AI interface |
| **Modernized Classics strategy** | Public domain works embedded with AI-generated modern language versions |
| **YouTube channel** | Audio sermons using ElevenLabs AI voice over simple visuals — no camera needed |
| **UX overhaul needed** | Current SACRED UX is functional but not polished enough for paying customers |
| **Voice profile created** | Professor mode calibration started from Romans 1:1-7 manuscript — see `memory/context/ricks-voice-profile.md` |

## Next Steps (Immediate)
1. **UX redesign planning** — Rick identifies what's wrong with current SACRED UX, we plan the overhaul
2. **Continue voice training** — Clawd reads remaining 4 sermon manuscripts from Drive
3. **Rick exports sample book content** (100 pages) — test the knowledge extraction pipeline
4. **Build in-app AI chat prototype** — conversational Bible study interface (RAG + Claude API)
5. **Pick first public domain work to modernize** — test the modernization pipeline (Spurgeon recommended)
6. **Begin Romans commentary** — AI-assisted, Rick-directed, Professor voice
7. **Legal review plan** — open source → commercial licensing (MIT license implications)
8. **YouTube channel strategy** — name, branding, content plan for audio sermons
9. **Explore Sermon Forge** — Rick's existing sermon development workflow on Drive may inform SACRED's sermon prep features
